\v 19 One of Sennacherib's important officials told them to take this message to Hezekiah:
\p "This is what the king of Assyria, the great king, says: 'What are you trusting in \add to rescue you\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\v 20 You say that you have weapons to fight us and some country promises \add to help you\add*, \add and that will enable you to defeat us\add*, but that is only talk \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Who do you think will help you to rebel against my \add soldiers from Assyria\add*?
\v 21 Listen to me! You are relying on the \add army of\add* Egypt. But that is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* using a broken reed for a walking stick on which you could lean. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt would be like for anyone who relied on him \add for help\add*.

\v 19 So Rabshakeh said to them to tell Hezekiah the following, which the great king, the king of Assyria, said: 
"What confidence is this in which you are trusting?
\v 20 You speak only vain words, saying  there is counsel and strength for war. Now in whom are you trusting? Who has emboldened you to rebel against me?
\v 21 Look, you trust in the walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt, upon which if a man leans it will stick into his hand and pierce it. That is Pharaoh king of Egypt to everyone who trusts in him.
