<usfm> \v 16 Then Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of Yahweh and from the pillars that he had overlaid; he gave the gold to the king of Assyria. \v 17 But the king of Assyria mobilized his great army, sending Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They traveled up the roads and arrived outside Jerusalem. They approached the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the launderers' field, and stood by it. \v 18 When they had called to King Hezekiah, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the recorder, the son of Asaph, went out to meet them. </usfm>
