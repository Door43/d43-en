\v 31 Do not pay attention to what Hezekiah says! This is what the king of Assyria says: 'Come out of the city and surrender to me. If you do that, I will arrange for each of you to drink the juice from you own grapevines, and to eat figs from your own trees, and to drink water from your own wells.
\v 32 You will be able to do that until we come and take you to a land that is like your land—a land where there is grain to make bread and vineyards to \add produce grapes for making\add* wine. It will be a land that has plenty of olive trees and honey. If you do what the king of Assyria commands, you will not die. You will continue to live.
\p Do not allow Hezekiah to persuade you to trust in Yahweh saying that he will rescue you!

\v 31 Listen not to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat you
every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink you every one the waters of his own cistern;
\v 32 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards,
a land of olive-trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and listen not to Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you,
saying, Jehovah will deliver us.
