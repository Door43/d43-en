===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - They take the new king, Joash, from the temple to the palace.

  * **the commanders of hundreds** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:11:04|11:4]]. The phrase "commander of hundreds" is probably an official title for a military officer. Possible meanings are 1) the word "hundreds" represents the exact amount of soldiers that each of these commanders led. AT: "the commanders of 100 soldiers" or 2) the word translated as "hundreds" does not represent an exact number, but is the name of a military division. AT: "the commanders of military divisions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Carites** - This is the name of a particular group of the royal guards.
  * **brought down the king from the house of Yahweh and they went into the king's house** - "brought the king from the temple to the palace"
  * **all the people of the land rejoiced** - This is a generalization. It is possible that some did not rejoice. AT: "many people in the land rejoiced" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **the city was quiet** - "the city was calm" or "the city was peaceful"
