\v 15 Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of hundreds who were over the army, saying, "Bring her out between the ranks. Anyone who follows her, kill him with the sword." For the priest had said, "Do not let her be killed in the house of Yahweh."
\v 16 So they seized her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds, and there she was killed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the commanders of hundreds** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:11:04|11:4]]. The phrase "commander of hundreds" is probably an official title for a military officer. Possible meanings are 1) the word "hundreds" represents the exact amount of soldiers that each of these commanders led. AT: "the commanders of 100 soldiers" or 2) the word translated as "hundreds" does not represent an exact number, but is the name of a military division. AT: "the commanders of military divisions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Bring her out between the ranks** - "Take her away between two rows of guards" or "Lead her away with a row of soldiers on each side of her." Ranks are lines or rows of soldiers.
  * **Anyone who follows her** - It is implied that a person who followed her would be trying to help her. AT: "Anyone who follows to try to rescue her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they seized her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds** - Some versions translate this as "the guards seized her and took her to the palace, to the place where horses enter the courtyard."
