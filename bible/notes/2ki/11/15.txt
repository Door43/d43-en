\v 15 Then Jehoiada, the priest, commanded the commanders of hundreds who were over the army; he said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks. Anyone who follows her, kill him with the sword.” For the priest had said, “Do not let her be killed in the house of Yahweh."
\v 16 So they made way for her, and she went by way of the horse gate to the king’s house, and there she was killed.
