\p
\v 1 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the point of dying. So Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, "Yahweh says, 'Set your house in order; for you will die, and not live.' "
\v 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, saying,
\v 3 "Please, Yahweh, call to mind how I have faithfully walked before you with my whole heart, and how I have done what was good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept loudly.
