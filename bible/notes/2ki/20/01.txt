\v 1 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the point of dying. So Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, "Yahweh says, 'Set your house in order; for you will die, and not live.' "
\v 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, saying,
\v 3 "Remember now, O Yahweh, I ask you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept intensely.
