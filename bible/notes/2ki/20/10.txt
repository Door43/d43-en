  * **It is an easy thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps** - Why "it is an easy thing" can be stated clearly. "It is easy to cause the shadow to move forward ten steps, because that is the normal thing for it to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the stairway of Ahaz** - See the comment in [[en:bible:notes:2ki:20:08|8-9]]. AT: "the steps that had been built for King Ahaz"
