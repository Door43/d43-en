\v 19 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of Yahweh that you have spoken is good." For he thought, "Will there not be peace and stability in my days?"
\v 20 As for the other matters concerning Hezekiah, and all his power, and how he constructed the pool and the conduit, and how he brought water into the cityâ€”are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Judah?
\v 21 Hezekiah slept with his ancestors, and Manasseh his son became king in his place.
