===== translationNotes: =====

  * **these men** - This refers to the men sent to King Hezekiah with a message and gifts from Marduk-Baladan. 
  * **They have seen everything in my house. There is nothing among my valuable things that I have not shown them** - Hezekiah repeats the same idea in two ways to emphasize his point. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **There is nothing among my valuable things that I have not shown them** - "Nothing" and "not" cancel each other out to make the idea positive. This exaggeration is used for emphasis. AT: "I showed them absolutely every one of my valuable things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
