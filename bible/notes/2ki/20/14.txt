===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **these men**  - This refers to the men sent to King Hezekiah with a message and gifts from Berodach Baladan. 
    * **They have seen everything in my house.  There is nothing among my valuable things that I have not shown them**  - Hezekiah repeats the same idea in two ways to emphasize his point. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
