\v 12 At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had
heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\v 13 And Hezekiah listened to those letters, and then showed the Babylonian messengers all the palace and his precious things, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.
