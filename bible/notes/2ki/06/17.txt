\v 17 Then he prayed, "Yahweh, I request that you open my servant's eyes in order that he can see \add what is out there\add*!" So Yahweh enabled the servant to look out and see that surrounding the hill on which the town \add was built\add* was a huge number of horses and chariots made of fire!

\v 18 When the army of Syria prepared to attack Elisha, he prayed again, saying, "Yahweh, cause all these soldiers to become blind!" Yahweh answered his prayer and caused them to be unable to see clearly.

\v 19 Then Elisha went to them and said, "You are not on the right road; this is not the city that you are searching for. I will take you to the man whom you are searching for." But he led them to Samaria, \add the capital of Israel\add*!

\v 17 Elisha prayed and said, "Yahweh, I beg that you will open his eyes that he may see." Then Yahweh opened the servant's eyes, and he saw. Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha!
\v 18 When the Arameans came down to him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh and said, "Strike these people blind, I ask you." So Yahweh made them blind, just as Elisha had asked.
\v 19 Then Elisha told the Arameans, "This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you are looking for." And he led them to Samaria.
