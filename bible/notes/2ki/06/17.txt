\v 17 Elisha prayed and said, "Yahweh, I beg that you will open his eyes that he may see." Then Yahweh opened the servant's eyes, and he saw. Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha!
\v 18 When the Arameans came down to him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh and said, "Make  these people blind, I ask you." So Yahweh made them blind, just as Elisha had asked.
\v 19 Then Elisha told the Arameans, "This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom
you are looking for." And he led them to Samaria.
