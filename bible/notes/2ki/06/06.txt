===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **So the man of God said** - "So Elisha asked,"
  * **who then cut off a stick, threw it in the water, and made the iron float** - God uses Elisha to perform a miracle. The ax head rises to the surface of the water and it stays there so the prophet can pick it up.
