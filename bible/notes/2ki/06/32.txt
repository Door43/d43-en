\v 32 But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a man from before him, but when the messenger came to Elisha, he said to the elders, "See how this son of
a murderer has sent to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?"
\v 33 And while he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him and he said, "Behold, this trouble is of Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?"
