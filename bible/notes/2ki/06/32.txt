\v 32 But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and
the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See you how this son of
a murderer has sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him:
is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?
\v 33 And while he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of
Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?
