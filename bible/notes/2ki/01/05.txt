\v 6 They replied, "A man came to meet us and said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him that Yahweh says, "'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you wish to ask Baal Zebub whether you will recover'?

\v 5 When the messengers returned to Ahaziah, he said to them, "Why have you returned?"
\v 6 They said to him, "A man came to meet us who said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, "Yahweh says this: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die.'"'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When the messengers returned to Ahaziah** - After meeting with Elijah, the messengers returned to the king instead of going to Ekron. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?** - This rhetorical question is asked as a rebuke for consulting Baal Zebub. This may be written as a statement. This is irony because they are definitely aware of the God of Israel. See how you translated a similar question in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:01:03|3:3]]. AT: "You fools! You know there is a God in Israel, but you were acting as though you did not know when you sent men to consult Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up** - When King Ahaziah was injured, he was placed in a bed. Yahweh said that he will never become well and be able to get out of the bed. See how you translated this statement in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:01:03|3:4]]. AT: "you will not recover and you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
