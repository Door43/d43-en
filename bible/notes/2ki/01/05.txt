\v 6 They said to him, "A man came to meet us who said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, "Yahweh says this: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When the messengers returned to Ahaziah** - AT "So Elijah went to meet the messengers and told that to them, and they returned to the king instead of going to Ekron.(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])"
  * **Is it because there is no God in Israel ... Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?"** - Sharing this remark in the form of a question puts emphasis on the folly of going to Baal Zebub. AT: "I suppose you sent men to see Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, because there is no God in Israel!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
