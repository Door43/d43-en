\v 11 Again King Ahaziah sent to Elijah another captain with fifty soldiers. This captain also said to Elijah, "You, man of God, the king says, 'Come down quickly.'"
\v 12 Elijah answered and said to them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." Again the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **fifty soldiers** - "50 soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **If I am a man of God, let fire** - Here Elijah speaks a command in the form of a conditional clause, the condition being "if he is a man of God." It is known that he is man of God, therefore, what he is commanding will happen. This can be written without the conditional clause. Translate this phrase the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:01:09|1:10]]. AT: "I am a man of God, therefore, let fire" or "I am a man of God, so I command that fire" 
  * **fire of God** - This means that the fire came from God. AT: "fire from God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_possession]])
