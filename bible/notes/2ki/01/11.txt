\v 11 Again King Ahaziah sent to Elijah another captain with fifty soldiers. This captain also said to Elijah, "You, man of God, the king says, 'Come down quickly.'"
\v 12 Elijah answered and said to them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." Again the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **fifty soldiers** - "50 soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven** - The captain had called Elijah a man of God, but the captain and the king did not show Elijah proper respect. Elijah said this so that fire would come down from heaven, and this would prove that Elijah really was a man of God and he deserved their respect. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:01:09|1:10]]. AT: "Since I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven" or "If I am a man of God as you have said, let fire come down from heaven"
  * **fire of God** - This means that the fire came from God. AT: "fire from God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_possession]])
