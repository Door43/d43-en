\v 15 So the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, "Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him." So Elijah arose and went down with him to the king.
\v 16 Later Elijah said to Ahaziah, "This is what Yahweh says, 'You have sent messengers to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron. Is it because there is no God in Israel from whom you can ask for information? So now, you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up;  you will certainly die.' "
