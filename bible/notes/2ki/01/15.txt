\v 15 The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, "Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him." So Elijah arose and went down with him to the king.
\v 16 Later Elijah said to Ahaziah, "This is what Yahweh says, 'You have sent messengers to consult with Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron. Is it because there is no God in Israel from whom you can ask for information? So now, you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up; you will certainly die.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Is it because there is no God in Israel from whom you can ask for information?** - This rhetorical question is asked as a rebuke for consulting Baal Zebub. This may be written as a statement. This is irony because the king is definitely aware of the God of Israel. AT: "You must think there is no God in Israel whom you may ask for information!" or "You fool! You know there is a God in Israel to consult, but you acted as if you did not know." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up** - When King Ahaziah was injured, he was placed in a bed. Yahweh said that he will never become well and be able to get out of the bed. See how you translated this statement in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:01:03|3:4]]. AT: "you will not recover and you will not get up from the bed where you are lying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
