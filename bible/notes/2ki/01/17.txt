\v 17 So King Ahaziah died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. Joram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
\v 18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
