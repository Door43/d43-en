  * **General Information:** - This is the end of the message from Yahweh to King Josiah through the prophetess Huldah.

  * **See, I will gather you to your ancestors; you will be gathered to your grave** - Both statements mean basically the same thing. They are polite ways of saying he will die. AT: "Listen, I will allow you to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **nor will your eyes see** - AT: "and you will not experience any of the disaster." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
