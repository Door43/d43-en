  * **See, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace** - Both statements mean basically the same thing. They are polite ways of saying he will die. AT: "So I will allow you to die and be buried peacefully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Your eyes will not see** - Here "will not see" represents not experiencing something. AT: "You will not experience" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Your eyes** - Here "eyes" represents the whole person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the disaster that I will bring upon this place** - Yahweh causing terrible things to happen is spoken of as if disaster were an object that Yahweh would bring to a place. AT: "the terrible things I will cause to happen in this place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
