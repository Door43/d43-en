The message from King Josiah to Hilkiah, the high priest, continues.

  * **carpenters** - workers who build with wood
  * **masons** - workers who build with stone
  * **no accounting was required for the money that was given to them** - "the workers did not have to report how they used the money that the temple guards gave to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **because they handled it faithfully** - AT: "because they used the money honestly"
