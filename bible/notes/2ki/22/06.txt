===== Translation Notes: =====


The message from King Josiah to Hilkiah, the high priest, continues.

    * **carpenters**  - workers who build with wood
    * **masons**  - workers who build with stone
    * **no accounting was required for the money that was given to them** - "the workers did not have to report how they used the money that the temple guards gave to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **because they handled it faithfully**  - AT: "because they used the money honestly"
