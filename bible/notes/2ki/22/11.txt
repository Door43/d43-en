\v 11 It came about that when the king had heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes. 
\v 12 The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, his own servant, saying,
\v 13 "Go and consult with Yahweh for me, and for the people and for all Judah, because of the words of this book that has been found.
For it is great, the anger of Yahweh that has been kindled against us. It is great, because our ancestors have not listened to the words of this book so as to obey all that was written concerning us."
