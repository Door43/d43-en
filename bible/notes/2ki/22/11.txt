\v 11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes.
\v 12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the
scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,
\v 13 Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found;
for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this
book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.
