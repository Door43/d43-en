====== 2 Kings 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The next two chapters (2 Kings 22-23) tell about the spiritual revival under King Josiah. A revival occurs when the people begin to worship Yahweh properly again. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The law ==
The priests found a copy of the law in the temple and took it to the king. He was upset because the people had disobeyed the law so badly. Josiah asked God about it. God said that he would destroy Judah for these sins but not in Josiah's lifetime, since he humbled himself and wanted to do better. Many scholars believe this was a copy of the book of Deuteronomy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]], [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]], [[:en:obe:kt:temple]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]]))
