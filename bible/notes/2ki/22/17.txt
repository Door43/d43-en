<usfm>
\v 17 I will do that because they have abandoned me, and they burn incense to \add honor\add* other gods. They have caused me to become very angry by all the idols that they have made \f + \ft Or: by all the wicked things that they have done \f*, and my anger is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a fire that will not be put out."
\v 18 The king of Judah sent you to inquire what I, Yahweh, wanted you to do, this is what you should say to him: "Because you have heeded what was written in the scroll,
\v 19 and you repented and humbled yourself when you heard what I said to warn to \add about what would happen to\add* this city and the people who live here and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you. I said that I would cause this city to be abandoned. It will be a city whose name people will use when they curse someone. But I have heard what you prayed,

\v 18 The king of Judah sent you to inquire what I, Yahweh, want him to do. This is what you should say to him, 'You have paid attention to what was written in the scroll.
\v 19 Also, you have repented and humbled yourself when you heard what I threatened to do to punish this city and the people who live here, I have heard what you prayed. I said that I would cause this city to be abandoned. It will be a city whose name people will use when they curse someone. But because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you.

\v 17 Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, so that they might provoke me to anger with all the deeds they have committed—therefore my anger has been kindled against this place, and it will not be extinguished.' "
\v 18 But to the king of Judah, who sent you to ask Yahweh’s will, this is what you will say to him: ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says this: About the words that you heard:
\v 19 'because your heart was tender, and because you have humbled yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I said against this place and its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and because you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have listened to you’—this is the declaration of Yahweh.
