\v 18 Jehoram walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab was doing; for he had Ahab's daughter as his wife, and he did what was evil in Yahweh's sight.
\v 19 However, because of his servant David, Yahweh did not want to destroy Judah, since he had told him that he would always give him descendants.
