\v 1 Now Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had restored to life. He said to her, "Arise, and go with your household, and stay wherever you can in another land, because Yahweh has called for a famine which will  come on this land for seven years."
\v 2 So the woman arose and she obeyed the word of the man of God. She went with her household and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years.
