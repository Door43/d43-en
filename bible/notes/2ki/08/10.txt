\v 10 Elisha said to him, "Go, say to Ben Hadad, 'You will surely recover,' but Yahweh has shown me that he will surely die."
\v 11 Then Elisha stared at Hazael until he was ashamed, and the man of God wept.
\v 12 Hazael asked, "Why do you weep, my master?" He answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, dash in pieces their little ones, and rip open their pregnant women."
