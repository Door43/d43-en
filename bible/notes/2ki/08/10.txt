\v 10 Elisha said to him, "Go, say to Benhadad, 'You will surely recover;' but Yahweh has showed me that he will 
surely die."
\v 11 Then Elisha stared at Hazael until he was ashamed, and the man of God wept.
\v 12 Hazael asked, "Why do you weep, my master?" And he answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel. You will set on fire their strongholds, and you will kill their young men with the sword and will dash in pieces
their little ones, and rip up their pregnant women."
