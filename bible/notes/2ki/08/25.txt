\v 25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.
\v 26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah; she was the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.
\v 27 Ahaziah walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; he did what was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as the house of Ahab was doing, for Ahaziah was a son-in-law to the house of Ahab.
