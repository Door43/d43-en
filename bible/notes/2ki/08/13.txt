===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who is your servant, that he should do this great thing?** - Hazel refers to himself here as Elisha's servant. Hazel uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he does not think he could do the terrible things that Elisha has said. This can be written as a statement. AT: "I could never do such great things!" or "Who am I, that I would have the power to do such things?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this great thing** - "this terrible thing." Here the word "great" refers to something that has a large effect and is terrible. 
  * **He is only a dog** - Hazael is talking about himself. He speaks of his low status and lack of influence by comparing himself to a dog. Here a dog represents a lowly animal. AT: "I am as powerless as a dog" or "I am as powerless as a lowly animal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **came to his master** - The phrase "his master" refers to Ben Hadad.
  * **face so that he died** - This means that Ben Hadad suffocated under the wet blanket. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "face. Ben Hadad was unable to breathe through it, and so he died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
