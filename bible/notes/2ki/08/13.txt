\v 13 Hazael replied, "But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Elisha answered,
"Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over Aram."
\v 14 Then Hazael departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" He  answered, "He told me that you would surely recover."
\v 15 Then the next day Hazael took the blanket and dipped it in water, and spread it on Benhadad's face so that he died. Then Hazael reigned in his stead.
