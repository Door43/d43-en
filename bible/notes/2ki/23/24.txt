\v 24 Furthermore, Josiah wiped out of Jerusalem and other places in Judah all the people who practiced sorcery and those who requested the spirits of dead people \add to tell them what they should do\add*. He also removed from Jerusalem and from the other places in Judah all the household idols and all the other idols and abominable things. He did those things in order to obey what had been written in the scroll that Hilkiah had found in the temple.
\v 25 Josiah was devoted to Yahweh with all that he felt and thought and with all his strength. There had never been \add in Judah or Israel\add* a king like him. He obeyed all the laws of Moses. And there has never since then been a king like Josiah.

\v 24 Josiah also banished those who talked with the dead or with spirits. He also banished the fetishes, the idols, and all the disgusting things that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, so as to confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of Yahweh.
\v 25 Before Josiah, there had been no king like him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, all his soul, and all his might, who followed all the law of Moses. Nor did any king like Josiah arise after him.
