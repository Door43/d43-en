He did those things in order to obey what had been written in the scroll that Hilkiah had found in the temple.
\v 25 Josiah was devoted to Yahweh with all that he felt and thought and with all his strength. There had never been \add in Judah or Israel\add* a king like him. He obeyed all the laws of Moses. And there has never since then been a king like Josiah.

\v 24 Moreover them that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that
were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were
written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Jehovah.
\v 25 And like to him was there no king before him, that turned to Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his soul, and
with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
