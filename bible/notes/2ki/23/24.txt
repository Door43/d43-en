\v 24 Also Josiah banished  necromanchers and mediums and  teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were

\v 25 And there was no king like Josiah before him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart and with all his soul and
with all his might, according to all the law of Moses. Neither after Josiah arose any king like him.
