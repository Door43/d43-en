\v 8 Josiah brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah and defiled the shrines where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the shrines at the gates, the shrines that were at the entrance to the Gate of Joshua, built by a city governor named Joshua. These shrines were to the left of the city gate as one entered the city.
\v 9 Even though the priests of those shrines were not allowed to serve at the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, they were allowed to eat unleavened bread, like their brother priests.
