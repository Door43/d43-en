\v 8 Josiah brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the high places at the gates that were at the entrance to the gate of Joshua (the city governor), on the left side of the city gate.
\v 9 Although the priests of those high places were not allowed to serve at the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Josiah brought ... and defiled ... He destroyed** - Josiah probably did not do all these things himself. It is likely that he commanded Hilkiah and the priests under him ([[:en:bible:notes:2ki:23:04|23:4]]), and they did the work. AT: "Josiah commanded Hilkiah and his servants to bring ... and defile ... As Josiah had commanded, Hilkiah and his servants destroyed"
  * **Geba ... Beersheba** - names of places (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Joshua (the city governor)** - "the city ruler named Joshua" or "the city leader named Joshua." This is a different Joshua from the Joshua in the Old Testament Book of Joshua.
  * **their brothers** - Here "brothers" refers to their fellow priests who served at the temple.
