  * **General Information:** - This continues to tell what King Josiah did in response to the message from Yahweh.

  * **He brought out ... and burned it ... He beat it ... and threw ... He cleared** - The word "he" refers to Josiah. He would have commanded his workers to do these things. Hilkiah and the priests who assisted him did these things. AT: "He had them bring out ... and burn it ... He had them beat it ... and throw ... He had them clear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **wove garments** - "made clothes"
