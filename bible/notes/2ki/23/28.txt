\v 28 Now the rest of the deeds of Josiah, everything that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 29 In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went to war against the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. King Josiah fought against Neco, and Pharaoh Neco came face to face with Josiah and killed him at Megiddo.
\v 30 Josiah's servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. 
Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place.
