\v 28 As for the other matters concerning Josiah, everything that he did, are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah?
\v 29 In his days, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went to fight against the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. King Josiah went to meet Neco in battle, and Neco killed him at Megiddo.
\v 30 Josiah's servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own grave. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in his father's place.
