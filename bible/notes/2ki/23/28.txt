\v 28 As for the other matters concerning Josiah, everything that he did, are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Judah?
\v 29 In his days, Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, went to fight against the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. King Josiah went to meet Necho in battle, and Necho killed him at Megiddo.
\v 30 Josiah's servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own grave. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in his father's place.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **are they not written ... Judah?** - This can be expressed in active form and assumes that the answer is positive. The question is rhetorical and is used for emphasis. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:08:22|8:23]]. AT: "you can find them ... Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **In his days, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt** - "During the time of Josiah, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt"
  * **Neco ... Megiddo** - Neco is the name of a man. Megiddo is the name of a city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
