\v 28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Judah?
\v 29 In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went
against him; and Pharaoh-necoh killed him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
\v 30 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own
sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s
stead.
