\v 15 Furthermore, he commanded them to tear down the place of worship at Bethel which had been built by King Jeroboam \add #1\add*, the king who persuaded the people of Israel to sin. They tore down the altar. Then they broke its stones into pieces and pounded them to become powder. They also burned the statue \add of the goddess\add* Asherah.
\v 16 Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs there on the hill. He commanded his men to take the bones out of those tombs and burn them on the altar. By doing that, he desecrated the altar. That was what a prophet had predicted many years before when Jeroboam \add #1\add* was standing close to that altar at a festival.
\p Then Josiah looked up and saw the tomb of the prophet who had predicted that.

\v 15 Josiah also broke down  the altar that was at Bethel and the shrine that Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the one who had made Israel sin, had constructed. He burned the altar at the shrine and beat it to dust; he also burned the Asherah pole.
\v 16 As Josiah looked over the area, he noticed the graves that were on the hillside. He sent men to take the bones from the graves; then he burned them on the altar, which defiled it. This was according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God had spoken, the man who spoke of these things beforehand.
