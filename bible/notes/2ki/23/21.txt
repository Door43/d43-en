\v 21 Then the king commanded all the people, saying, "Keep the Passover for Yahweh your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant."
\v 22 Such a Passover celebration had never been held from the days of the judges who ruled Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel or Judah.
\v 23 However, this Passover was indeed celebrated in the eighteenth year of King Josiah; it was for Yahweh in Jerusalem.
