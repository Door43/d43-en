\v 21 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of
the covenant.
\v 22 Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the
kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
\v 23 but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to Jehovah in Jerusalem.
