\v 6 But by the twenty-third year of king Joash, the priests had not repaired anything in the temple.
\v 7 Then king Joash called for Jehoiada the priest and for the other priests; he said to them, "Why have you not repaired anything in the temple? Now take no more money from your taxpayers, but take what has been collected for repairs of the temple to those who can make the repairs."
\v 8 So the priests consented to take no more money from the people and not repair the temple themselves.
