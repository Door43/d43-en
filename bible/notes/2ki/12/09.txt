\v 9 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as
one comes into the house of Jehovah: and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into
the house of Jehovah.
\v 10 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up,
and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.
