====== 2 Kings 16 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Ahaz ==
Ahaz was a wicked king. Israel and Aram united to fight against him; so he paid the Assyrian king to attack Aram. Assyria defeated the people of Aram and took them into captivity. The people were to trust in Yahweh and not rely on military alliances with other Gentile nations. This showed a lack of trust in the power of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])
