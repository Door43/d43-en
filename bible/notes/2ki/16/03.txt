\v 3 Instead, he was as sinful as the kings of Israel had been. He even sacrificed his son to be an offering to idols. That imitated the disgusting things that the people who previously lived there had done, people whom Yahweh had expelled as the Israelites were advancing through the land.
\v 4 He offered sacrifices and burned incense \add to honor Yahweh\add* on the tops of many hills and under many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* big trees, \add instead of in Jerusalem as Yahweh had commanded\add*.

\v 3 Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel; indeed, he put his son in the fire as a burnt offering, following the detestable practices of the nations, which Yahweh had driven out before the people of Israel.
\v 4 He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops, and under every green tree.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he walked in the way of the kings of Israel** - Walking represents behavior and actions. AT: "King Ahaz acted the same way that the kings of Israel had acted" or "he did the things that the kings of Israel had done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **following the detestable practices of the nations** - Here "following" represents doing what others do. AT: "copying the disgusting things that the other nations did, the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the nations** - The word "nations" represents the people of other nations. Here it refers to the people of the nations who had lived in that land. AT: "the people of other nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **which Yahweh had driven out** - "Drive out" means "force out." AT: "which Yahweh had forced to leave"
  * **before the people of Israel** - The people of those nations fled as the people of Israel moved into the land. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "before the people of Israel who moved into the land" or "as the people of Israel moved into the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the high places, on the hilltops, and under every green tree** - These are places where the people of the other nations worshiped their false gods. 
  * **under every green tree** - God wanted his people to offer sacrifices to him in Jerusalem. The word "every" here is an exaggeration to show how determined King Ahaz was to disobey God by offering sacrifices in many other places instead. AT: "under many green trees" or "under many green trees around the country" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
