===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **our eyes have grown dim** - AT: "we can hardly see because of our tears"
  * **jackals** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lam:04:03|4:3]]. Ruined, deserted places were thought to be inhabited by certain kinds of wild animals, including jackals.
