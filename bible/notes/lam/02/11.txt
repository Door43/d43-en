<usfm>
\q
\v 11 My tears have ended; my eyes are red; my innermost parts are in turmoil. 
\q My liver has been poured out to the ground because of the crushing of the daughter of my people,
\q because the young children and the nursing babies are helplessly weak in the streets of the villages.
\q
\v 12 They say to their mothers, "Where is grain and wine?"
\q fainting like wounded men in the streets of the city,
\q their lives being poured out onto their mothersâ€™ laps.
