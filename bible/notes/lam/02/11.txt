<usfm>
\q
\v 11 My eyes have failed from their tears; my stomach churns;
\q my inner parts are poured out to the ground because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
\q children and infants faint in the streets of the city. 
\q
\v 12 They say to their mothers, "Where is grain and wine?"
\q as they faint like a wounded man in the streets of the city,
\q their lives are poured out on the bosom of their mothers.

  * **my stomach churns** - The word "churn" means to move around violently, normally in a circular rotation. This does not mean the stomach is literally churning, but describes how the author feels. AT: "my insides ache" or "my stomach hurts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my inner parts are poured out to the ground** - The author speaks of feeling grief in his inner being as if his inner body parts had fallen out of his body onto the ground. AT: "my entire inner being is in grief" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
