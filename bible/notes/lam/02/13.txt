===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 You people of Jerusalem,
\q2 I cannot say anything to help you.
\q1 No people have suffered like you are suffering;
\q2 I do not know what I can do to comfort you.
\q1 You have fallen just as far
\q2 as if you had sunk in the ocean;
\q2 there is no one who can bring your city back to what it was.
\b
\q1
\v 14 The prophets among you claimed that they had seen visions from Yahweh,
\q2 but what they said was false and worthless.
\q1 They did not work to save you from your enemies;
\q2 they did not tell you that you had sinned.
\q1 Instead, they announced to you things that they said Yahweh had told them; 
\q2 they tempted you to believe them, and you did.
\b

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 What can I say regarding you, daughter of Jerusalem?
\q What will I compare to you to comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion?
\q Your collapse is as great as the sea. Who can heal you?
\q
\v 14 Your prophets have seen deceitful and foolish visions for you.
\q They have not revealed your iniquity to restore your fortunes,
\q but have perceived deceitful oracles and temptations for you.
