===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He has given over the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy** - Here the enemy's "hand" refers to the enemy's control. AT: "He has allowed the enemy to capture the walls of her palaces" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the walls of her palaces** - Here the word "her" may refer either to Jerusalem or to the temple. Possible translations are 1) "the walls of Jerusalem's palaces" or 2) "the walls of the temple." 
  * **her palaces** - Jerusalem is spoken of as if it were female. 
  * **They have raised a shout in the house of Yahweh, as on the day of an appointed feast** - This is an ironic comparison between the happy, noisy festivals of Israel and the loud shouts of victory of the Babylonians. AT: "They have raised a shout in the house of Yahweh, as the Israelites would during an appointed feast" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **have raised a shout** - This is an idiom. AT: "shouted victoriously" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
