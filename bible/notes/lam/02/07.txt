  * **He has given over...into the hand of the enemy** - AT: "He has turned over...to the enemy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the walls of her citadels** - Here the word "her" may refer either to Jerusalem or to the temple. Possible translations are 1) "the walls of Jerusalem's palaces" or 2) "the walls of the temple." 
  * **They have made a sound of victory in the house of Yahweh, as on the day of a solemn assembly.** - This is an ironic comparison between the happy, noisy festivals of Israel and the loud shouts of victory of the Babylonians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
