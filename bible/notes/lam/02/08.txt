<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Yahweh decided to destroy the city wall of the daughter of Zion.
\q He has stretched out the measuring line and has not withheld his hand from destroying the wall.
\q He has made the ramparts and wall to lament; together they wasted away.
\q
\v 9 Her gates have sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken the bars of her gate.
\q Her king and her princes are among the nations, the law is no more
\q and her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh decided to destroy the city wall** - Yahweh chose to have the wall destroyed and caused Jerusalem's enemy to destroy it. He did not destroy it himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **daughter of Zion** - This is a poetic name for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **He has stretched out the measuring line** - This speaks of preparing to destroy the wall as if he measured it before he destroyed it, so that he knew how much to destroy. AT: "It is as though he has measured the wall" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **has not withheld his hand from destroying** - This can be stated without the double negatives. Also, here the Lord is referred to by his "hand." AT: "with his hand he has destroyed the wall" or "he has destroyed the wall" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **He has made the ramparts and wall to lament; together they wasted away** - The walls and ramparts are spoken of as if they were people who lamented and died. AT: "Because he has destroyed the ramparts and walls, they are like people who lament and have lost their strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **ramparts** - Ancient cities had a main "wall" to keep attackers out, and an outer line of "ramparts" to keep attackers from the wall.
