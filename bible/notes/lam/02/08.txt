<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Yahweh has deliberately decided to destroy the city wall of the daughter of Zion.
\q He has stretched out the measuring line and has not withheld his hand from destroying the wall.
\q And he has made the ramparts lament and the walls become feeble.
\q
\v 9 Her gates have sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken her gate bars.
\q Her king and her princes are among the Gentiles, where there is no law of Moses.
\q Even her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **daughter of Zion** - This is a poetic name for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **He has stretched out the measuring line** - AT: "He has measured the length of the wall" so he knows exactly how much to destroy (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **has not withheld his hand from destroying** - AT: "He has destroyed using all his power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
    * **withheld his hand** - "kept his hand to himself"
    * **he has made the ramparts lament and the walls become feeble** - "because he has destroyed the ramparts and walls, they look like people who lament and have lost their strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **ramparts** - Ancient cities had a main "wall" to keep attackers out, and an outer line of "ramparts" to keep attackers from the wall.
