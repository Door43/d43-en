<usfm>
\q
\v 15 All those who pass along the road clap their hands at you.
\q They hiss and shake their heads against the daughter of Jerusalem and say,
\q "Is this the city that they called 'The Perfection of Beauty,' 'The Joy for All of Earth'?"
\q
\v 16 All your enemies open their mouths wide and mock you.
\q They whistle and grind their teeth; they say, "We have swallowed her!
\q Certainly this is the day for which we waited! We have found it! We have seen it!"
