\q "Walls of the Daughter of Zion, let tears flow down like a river day and night.
\q Give yourself no reprieve. Do not stop the outflow of your eyes.

\q pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. 
\q Lift up your hands unto Him for the life of your children who languish with hunger at the head of every street.
\b
