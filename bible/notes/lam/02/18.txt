<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Their heart shouts to the Lord,
\q "Walls of the daughter of Zion, let tears flow down like a river day and night.
\q Give yourself no reprieve. Do not stop the outflow of your eyes.
\q
\v 19 Stand and cry out in the night; from the beginning of the watches
\q pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. 
\q Lift up your hands to him for the life of your children who lie weak with hunger at the head of every street."
\b
