===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues the use of metaphors to express God's opposition to Judah.

  * **cut off all the strength of Israel**  - The word that is translated "strength" here is literally the "horn" of an animal, which in this imagery "God has cut off". The horn is what an animal uses to attack and defend. See Lam. 2:17. (See: Metaphor)
  * **drawn back his right hand**  - The right hand is the one that holds a weapon, such as a sword. God intentionally held back from protecting Judah from harm. (See: Synecdoche)
  * **He has bent his bow at us…with his hand ready to shoot**  - When a soldier fixed an arrow in the bow and pulled it back to shoot, this bent the wooden bow. "He prepared his bow to shoot an arrow aimed at us…he is ready to let the arrow go and hit us." (See: Metaphor)
  * **In the tent of the Daughter of Zion**  - Judah and Jerusalem are like a tent in which people live. (See: Metaphor)
  * **poured out his wrath like fire**  - God's anger, like fire, completely destroys things. (See: Simile)
  * **He **- "the Lord" or "God"
