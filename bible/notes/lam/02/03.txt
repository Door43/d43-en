===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues the use of metaphors to express God's opposition to Judah.

  * **he has cut off all the strength of Israel** - Some versions read, "He has cut off the horn of Israel," but "horn" (that is, an animal horn) stands for "strength." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **drawn back his right hand** - "stopped protecting us from our enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He has strung his bow at us** - Some versions read, "He has bent his bow." A soldier had to put the string on his bow before he could shoot it. AT: "He has made his bow ready to shoot us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **tent of the daughter of Zion** - AT: "the people's homes in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **daughter of Zion** - These is a poetic name for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. (See: Personification)
  * **poured out his wrath like fire** - "shown how angry he is by destroying everything like a person setting fires would" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
