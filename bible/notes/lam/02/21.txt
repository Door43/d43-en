\q
\v 21 Both the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets.
\q My virgins and my vigorous men have fallen by the sword.
\q You have slaughtered them in the day of your wrath; you have killed ruthlessly and shown no compassion.
\q
\v 22 You have summoned my terrors from all around as in the day of the solemn assembly;
\q no one escaped, and there was no survivor on the day of Yahweh's wrath.
\q Those who I nurtured and raised, my enemy has brought to an end.
