\q
\v 21 Both the young and the old lie on the dust of the streets.
\q My young women and my young men have fallen by the sword;
\q you have slaughtered them without taking pity on them.
\q
\v 22 You have summoned, as you would call the people to a feast day, my terrors on every side, on the day of the anger of Yahweh no one escaped or survived;
\q those I cared for and raised,
\q my enemy has destroyed.
