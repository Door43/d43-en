===== Translation Notes: =====

A new poem begins. The writer of Lamentations uses many different ways to express that the people of Israel have lost God's favor. (See:  [[en:ta:workbench:translate:poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] ​and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
