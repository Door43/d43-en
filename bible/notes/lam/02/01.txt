===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer of Lamentations uses many different ways to express the people of Israel losing his favor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with a dark cloud** - The Lord covers Jerusalem with a cloud as a person might cover something ugly they don’t want to look at. 
  * **Daughter of Zion...the beauty of Israel...Daughter of Judah** - The city of Jerusalem is referred to in different ways in this passage.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **cast down the beauty of Israel from heaven to the earth** - Jerusalem is compared with a star falling from heaven. This refers to Jerusalem losing favor with God.
  * **ignored his footstool** - The word “footstool” may refer to either 1) the Ark of the Covenant or 2) the temple that housed the Ark of the Covenant. Possible meanings are 1) "not considered his covenant" or 2) "has removed his presence."
  * **day of his anger** - Here the word "day" refers to a general period of time and not to one 24-hour day. AT: "at the time when he displayed his anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **swallowed up** - This phrase refers to Israel being completely destroyed like food is completely gone when it is swallowed. 
  * **the fortified cities of the Daughter of Judah** - This may refer to either 1) the the fortified walls of Jerusalem, or 2) the fortified cities throughout Judah.
