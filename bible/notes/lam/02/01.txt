===== Translation Notes: =====

A new poem begins. The writer of Lamentations uses many different ways to express that the people of Israel have lost God's favor. (See:  [[en:ta:workbench:translate:poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] â€‹and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 

  * **dark cloud** - Possible meanings are 1) God is threatening to harm the people of Jerusalem or 2) God has already harmed the people (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]). 
  * **daughter of Zion...daughter of Judah** - These are poetic names for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **He has cast down the beauty of Israel from heaven to the earth** - "Jerusalem has lost all favor with the Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  *  **ignored his footstool** - Possible meanings are 1) "not considered his covenant" or 2) "has removed his presence." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **day of his anger** - a general period of time, not one 24-hour day AT: "at the time when he displayed his anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **swallowed up** - "completely destroyed" like an animal leaves nothing when he swallows food (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  *  **the fortified cities of the daughter of Judah** - Possible meanings are 1) the fortified cities throughout Judah, or 2) the fortified walls of Jerusalem.
