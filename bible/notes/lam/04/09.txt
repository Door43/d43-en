\v 9 Those who have been killed by the sword are better off than those killed by hunger;
\q they are better off than those who waste away, pierced by hunger for the lack of any crops from fields.
\q
\v 10 The hands of compassionate women boiled their own children; these children
\q became their food during the crushing of the daughter of my people.
