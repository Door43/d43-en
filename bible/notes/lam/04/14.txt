\q
\v 14 They now wander as blind men in the streets. They are defiled by that blood
\q so none are able to even touch their clothes.
\q
\v 15 "Flee! Unclean!" they cry out, "Flee, flee! Do not touch me!"
\q So they wander abroad, but among the Gentiles people say, "They can no longer live here as foreigners!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They are defiled by that blood** - Because they have committed murder, they are ritually unclean, unable to worship God or be with ordinary people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **"Flee! Unclean," these prophets and priests cry out** - Some versions translate these words as being spoken by the ordinary people, not the murderous prophets and priests.
