\q
\v 14 they now wander as blind men in the streets. They are defiled by that blood
\q so none are able to even touch their clothes.
\q
\v 15 "Flee! Unclean" they cry out, "Flee, flee! Do not touch me!"
\q So they wander abrouad and say among the Gentiles," They no longer dwell as sojourners here!"
