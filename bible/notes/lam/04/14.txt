\q
\v 14 They now wander as blind men in the streets. They are defiled by that blood
\q so none are able to even touch their clothes.
\q
\v 15 "Flee! Unclean" they cry out, "Flee, flee! Do not touch me!"
\q So they wander abroad, but among the Gentiles people say," They can no longer live here as foreigners!"
