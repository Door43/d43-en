===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Those prophets and priests now wander like blind men in the streets. They are defiled by that blood
\q so no one is able to even touch their clothes.
\q
\v 15 "Flee! Unclean," yhese prophets and priests cry out. "Flee, flee! Do not touch us!"
\q So they wander to other lands, but even the Gentiles say, "They can no longer live here as foreigners."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They are defiled by that blood** - Because they have committed murder, they are ritually unclean, unable to worship God or be with ordinary people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **"Flee! Unclean," these prophets and priests cry out** - Some versions translate these words as being spoken by the ordinary people, not the murderous prophets and priests.
