===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Rejoice and be glad** - These two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. The writer uses these words sarcastically. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **daughter of Zion...daughter of Edom** - These are poetic names for the people of Jerusalem and of the land of Edom, which are spoken of here as if they were woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the cup will also pass to you** - The wine that people will drink from the cup is a symbol of Yahweh's anger. AT: "Yahweh will also judge you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Your guilt is ended** - Here "guilt" refers to the punishment for guilt. AT: "Yahweh has fully punished your guilt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He will no longer keep you in exile** - Here the word "He" refers to Yahweh.
  * **He will yet uncover your sins** - "He will soon expose your sins"
