\q
\v 7 Her leaders used to shine like snow and were as white as milk.
\q Their bodies were more ruddy than coral; their form like sapphire.

\q for their skin clings to their withered bones. It has become as dry as wood!

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Her leaders used to shine like snow and were as white as milk** - Possible meanings; 1) "Our leaders were previously beautiful to look at" (UDB) because they were physically healthy or 2) the people loved their leaders because the leaders were morally pure the way new snow and milk are pure white. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **her leaders** - Jerusalem's leaders
  * **ruddy** - healthy looking
  * **coral** - a rock-hard red substance that comes from the ocean used like jewelry
  * **sapphire** - a costly blue stone used in jewelry
  * **darkness blackens their appearance** - This may mean  1) that the sun has darkened the leaders' skin or 2) that the soot from the fires that burned Jerusalem has covered their faces.
  * **they are unrecognizable** - AT: "No one can recognize them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **has become as dry as wood** - because they do not have enough food and water (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
