\q1
\v 20 Our king, whom Yahweh had appointed,
\q2 the one who enabled us to live,
\q1 the one whom we trusted to protect us
\q2 when we had to live in the other nations as slaves—
\q1 the enemy captured him,
\q2 as you would capture an animal in a pit.

<usfm>
\q
\v 19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the sky.
\q They chased us to the mountains and lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
\q
\v 20 The breath in our nostrils, Yahweh's anointed one—our king, was captured in their pits;
\q it was our king of whom we said, "We will live under his protection among the nations."
\b
