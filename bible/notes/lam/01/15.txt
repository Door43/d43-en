===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **my mighty men who defended me** - In this section Jerusalem is still described as a woman talking about herself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **vigorous men** - men at the strongest time of their lives
    * **The Lord has trampled ... in a winepress** - Here the judgement of God is described as if Jerusalem was a bunch of grapes that God squashed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **the virgin daughter of Judah** - This is a poetic name for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. The word "virgin" suggests that this woman is pure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
