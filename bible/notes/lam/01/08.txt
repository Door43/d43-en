<usfm>
\v 8 We, the people of Jerusalem, have sinned very much;
\q2 our city has become like a bloody rag between a woman's legs.
\q1 Everyone who previously honored our city now despise it;
\q2 they are like people who strip a woman bare and then mock her.
\q1 Now we groan in the city;
\q2 we are like a woman without clothes who tries to cover herself with her hands.
\q1
\v 9 It is as if our city has become filthy because we have sinned so greatly;
\q2 we did not think about how God would punish us.
\q1 We did not imagine how we would suffer;
\q2 there is no one to comfort us.
\q1 We all call out to God, "Yahweh, look at how we are suffering
\q2 because our enemies have defeated us!"


\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Jerusalem sinned greatly, therefore, she has become scorned as something that is filthy.
\q All who honored her now despise her since they have seen her nakedness.
\q She groans and tries to turn away.
\q
\v 9 She has become unclean beneath her skirts. She did not think about her future.
\q Her fall was terrible. There was no one to comfort her.
\q She cried out, "Look at my affliction, Yahweh, for the enemy has become too great!"

  * **Jerusalem sinned greatly, therefore, she has become scorned as something that is filthy** - This speaks of Jerusalem being scorned in the same way that a woman is scorned when she is unclean. According to the Law of Moses, a woman was considered unclean during her monthly bleeding. AT: "Jerusalem's sins have made her filthy and unclean, and therefore she was unacceptable before God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Jerusalem sinned greatly** - This describes Jerusalem as a woman who sinned, while it also stands for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. AT: "The people of Jerusalem sinned greatly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **has become scorned** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "has become an object of scorn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **her nakedness** - "her naked." Jerusalem is described as a woman whose private parts have been exposed to everyone to shame her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **She has become unclean beneath her skirts** - According to the Law of Moses, a woman was considered unclean during her monthly bleeding. This speaks of Jerusalem being unclean, as if it were a menstruating woman. AT: "Jerusalem has become unclean, as when a woman is unclean beneath her skirts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **unclean** - A person who God considers to be spiritually unacceptable or defiled is spoken of as if the person were physically unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Her fall was terrible** - The phrase "her fall" is an idiom. AT: "Her downfall was astonishing" or "Those who saw her destruction were surprised" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Look at my affliction, Yahweh** - Possible meanings are that 1) the author of Lamentations now talks directly to Yahweh or 2) Jerusalem is described as talking to Yahweh like a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Look at** - "Pay attention to"
  * **the enemy has become too great** - This means that they enemy army has become too large and powerful and has defeated Jerusalem. AT: "the enemy army has defeated me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
