\v 8 We, the people of  Jerusalem, have sinned very much;
\q2 our city has become like a bloody rag between a woman's legs.
\q1 Everyone who previously honored our city now despise it;
\q2 they are like people who strip a woman bare and then mock her.
\q1 Now we groan in the city;
\q2 we are like a woman without clothes who tries to cover herself with her hands.

\v 9 It is as if our city has become filthy because we have sinned so greatly;

\q1 We all call out to God, "Yahweh, look at how we are suffering
\q2 because our enemies have defeated us!
