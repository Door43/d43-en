<usfm>
\q
\v 21 Hear me groan. There is no one to comfort me.
\q All my enemies have heard of my adversity. They rejoice that you have done it.
\q Bring the day that you have proclaimed; may they become like me.
\q
\v 22 Let all their wickedness come before you.
\q Torment them as you have tormented me for all my transgressions; 
\q for my groans are many, and my heart is weak.
