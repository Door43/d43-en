\v 21 People have heard us while we groaned,
\q2 but no one \add came to\add* comfort us.
\q1 \add Yahweh\add*, you caused us to experience this \add disaster\add*,
\q2 and our enemies are happy to see what you have done \add to us\add*.
\q1 But cause it soon to be the time that you have promised,
\q2 when our enemies will suffer like we have suffered!
\b
\q1
\v 22 Yahweh, see all the evil deeds that they have committed
\q2 and punish them!
\q1 \add Punish them\add* like you have punished us
\q2 for all the sins that we committed.
\q1 \add We say this to you\add* because we suffer and groan very much,

<usfm>
\v 21 Here my groaning!
\q2 but no one came to comfort me.
\q1 All our enemies know what happened to me;
\q2 they were all happy to hear 
\q2 about what Yahweh has done to his people.
\q1 Please do soon what you have promised,
\q2 when our enemies will suffer like we have suffered!
\b
\q1
\v 22 Yahweh, let those evils deeds come near to you
\q2 so you may see them all!
\q1 Punish them as you have punished me
\q2 for all my sins!
\q1 I suffer and groan very much,
\q2 and I faint within my inner self.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 21 Hear me groan. There is no one to comfort me.
\q All my enemies have heard of my adversity. They rejoice that you have done it.
\q Bring on the day you have promised, that they may they become like me.
\q
\v 22 Let all their wickedness come before you.
\q Torment them as you have tormented me for all my transgressions; 
\q for my groans are many, and my heart is weak.
