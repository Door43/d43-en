\v 19 I pleaded with our allies, in whom we trusted, to help,
\q2 but they all refused,

\q
\v 18 Yahweh is righteous, for I have rebelled against his commandment.
\q Hear, all you peoples, and see my sorrow.
\q My virgins and my vigorous men have gone into captivity.
\q
\v 19 I called for my friends, but they were treacherous toward me.
\q My priests and my elders perished in the city,
\q while they sought food to restore their lives.
\b
