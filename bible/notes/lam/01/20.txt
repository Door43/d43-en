<usfm>
\v 20 Yahweh, see that I am suffering very much!
\q2 Inside of my body I am in great distress.
\q1 I am sad in the center of my being,
\q2 because I have rebelled against you
\q2 and have caused you great sadness!
\q1 Our enemies kill people in the streets with their swords;
\q2 and that makes our homes the places where the dead are kept. 
\b

<usfm>
\q
\v 20 Look, Yahweh, for I am in distress; my innermost parts churn about.
\q My heart is turned within me for I have grievously rebelled.
