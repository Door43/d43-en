<usfm>
\q
\v 13 It is from on high that he has sent fire into my bones, and it has conquered them.
\q He has spread a net for my feet and turned me back.
\q He has made me constantly desolate and weak.
\q
\v 14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound together by his hand.
\q They are knit together and placed upon my neck. He has made my strength fail.
\q The Lord has given me over into their hands, and I am not able to stand.
