\v 13 From on high has he sent fire into my bones, and it has conquered them.
\q He has spread a net for my feet and turned me back.
\q He has made me desolate and weak constantly.
\q
\v 14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand.
\q They are knit together and placed upon my neck. He has made my strength fail.
\q The Lord has delivered me into their hands and I am not able to stand.
