\v 16 For these things I weep. My eyes, water flows down from my eyes
\q since the comforter that should restore my life is far from me.
\q My children are desolate, because the enemy has triumphed.
\q
\v 17 Zion has spread her hands wide; there is none to comfort her.
\q Yahweh has commanded that those around Jacob should be his adversaries.
\q Jerusalem is like a menstrual rag to them.
