\v 16 For these things I weep. My eyes, water flows down from my eyes
\q since the comforter that should restore my life is far from me.

  * **I weep** - This is still Jerusalem speaking as if it were a woman, now having the emotion of sadness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Zion has spread her hands wide** - Zion is like a person that lifts up her hands to ask for help. Here Jerusalem no longer speaks herself, but the author describes Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **those around Jacob** - AT: "the people around Jacob" or "the nations surrounding Jacob"
  * **should be his adversaries** - Here the word "his" refers to Jacob.
