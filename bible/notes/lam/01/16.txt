<usfm>
\q
\v 16 For these things I weep. My eyes, water flows down from my eyes
\q since the comforter that should restore my life is far from me.
\q My children are desolate because the enemy has triumphed.
\q
\v 17 Zion has spread her hands wide; there is none to comfort her.
\q Yahweh has commanded that those around Jacob should be his adversaries.
\q Jerusalem is something unclean to them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I weep** - This is still Jerusalem speaking as if it were a woman, now having the emotion of sadness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Zion has spread her hands wide** - Zion is like a person that lifts up her hands to ask for help. Here Jerusalem no longer speaks herself, but the author describes Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **those around Jacob** - AT: "the people around Jacob" or "the nations surrounding Jacob"
  * **should be his adversaries** - Here the word "his" refers to Jacob.
