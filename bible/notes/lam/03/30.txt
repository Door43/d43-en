===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer speaks of the one who waits for Yahweh ([[:en:bible:notes:lam:03:25|3:25]]).

  * **Let him offer his cheek to the one who strikes him** - The word "him" refers to anyone who is suffering and who waits for Yahweh. Here "offer his cheek" represents allowing someone to strike his cheek. AT: "Let him allow people to hit him on the face" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **let him be filled to the full with reproach** - The author speaks of a person as if he were a container and reproach were a liquid. Being filled with reproach represents being reproached much. The implication is that he should be patient when this happens. AT: "let him be insulted much" or "let him be patient when people reproach him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **though he causes grief** - "though the Lord causes people to suffer" or "though he afflicts people"
  * **he will have compassion** - "he will be compassionate to them"
  * **For he does not afflict from his heart** - Here the heart represents desire or pleasure, and afflicting from the heart represents afflicting willingly or with pleasure. AT: "For he does not afflict people willingly" or "He does not take pleasure in afflicting people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the children of mankind** - This refers to people in general. AT: "human beings" or "people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
