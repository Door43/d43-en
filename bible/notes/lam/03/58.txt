===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you defended my case, you saved my life!** - This presents a picture of a courtroom, where the speaker is on trial. In this picture, God argues for him, as a lawyer argues for his client. AT: "you argued for me in court" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **judge my case** - Here God is no longer pictured as a lawyer, but as the judge. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **their insults, all their plots against me** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **heard their scorn** - AT: "heard them taunt me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
