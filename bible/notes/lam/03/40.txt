    * **Let us lift up our hearts and our hands...and pray** - It was customary for the Israelites to raise their hands when praying to God. AT: "Let us pray sincerely with lifted hands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **We have transgressed and have rebelled** - The words "transgressed" and "rebelled" share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **against you** - Here the word "you" refers to God.
    * **You have covered yourself with anger** - Here anger is spoken of as if it were a garment that God has put on. Hebrew often spoke of emotions as if they were clothing. AT: "You have been angry." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
