\v 14 Uzziah prepared for them—for all the army, shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.
\v 15 In Jerusalem he built engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and large stones. His fame spread to distant lands, for he was greatly helped until he became very powerful.
