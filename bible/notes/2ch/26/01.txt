===== translationNotes: =====

  * **All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah** - The word "All" is a generalization. Some people may not have wanted him to be king. AT: "The people of Judah took the 16 year-old Uzziah and made him king after his father, Amaziah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **sixteen ... fifty-two** - "16 ... 52" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **It was he who rebuilt Elath** - Uzziah did not do this alone. AT: "It was he who ordered Elath to be rebuilt" or "It was he who supervised the rebuilding of Elath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Elath** - a city in Judah (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **restored it to Judah** - "returned it to Judah." This means that his army captured the city so that now it belonged to Judah again.
  * **slept with his ancestors** - This is a polite way to say he died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
