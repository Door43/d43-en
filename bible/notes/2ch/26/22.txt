\v 22 As for the other matters concerning Uzziah, first and last, are in what Isaiah the prophet (the son of Amoz), wrote.
\v 23 So Uzziah slept with his ancestors; they buried him with his ancestors in a burial ground that belonged to the Kings, for they said, "He is a leper." Jotham, his son, became king in his place.
