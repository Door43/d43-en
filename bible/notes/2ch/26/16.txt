\v 16 But when Uzziah had become powerful, his heart was lifted up so that he acted corruptly; he trespassed against Yahweh, his God, for he went into the house of Yahweh to burn incense on the altar of incense.
\v 17 Azariah, the priest, went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were courageous men.
\v 18 They resisted Uzziah, the king, and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh,
but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed. There will no honor for you in this from Yahweh God.”
