===== translationNotes: =====


  * **what was right in the eyes of Yahweh** - The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:14:01|14:2]].

  * **following the example of his father, Amaziah, in everything** - This implies that his father had done what was right in God's eyes. AT: "just as his father, Amaziah, had done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in everything** - This is a generalization. AT: "in the same way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])

  * **in the days of Zechariah** - Here "the days of Zechariah" is a metonym referring to the time period during which Zechariah was priest. AT: "when Zechariah was priest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
