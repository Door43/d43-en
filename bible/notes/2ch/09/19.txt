\v 19 Twelve lions stood on the steps, one on each side of each of the six steps. There was no throne like it in any other kingdom.
\v 20 All King Solomon's drinking cups were gold, and all the drinking cups in the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were silver because silver was not considered valuable in Solomon's days.
\v 21 The king had at sea a fleet of oceangoing ships, along with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet brought gold, silver, and ivory, as well as apes and baboons.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the House of the Forest of Lebanon** - Solomon's palace was built of trees from Lebanon. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:09:15|9:16]]. Possible meanings are 1) this was the name of a large room in the palace. AT: "the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon" or 2) this was the name of his whole palace. AT: "the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **silver was not considered valuable in Solomon's days** - Silver was so common in Solomon's days that if a king wanted to show his wealth, he would not do it by making things out of silver. Instead he would use gold, which was less common and more valuable. This can be stated in active form. AT: "people did not value silver so much" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in Solomon's days** - Here "Solomon's days" refers to the time when Solomon ruled. AT: "when Solomon ruled" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a fleet of oceangoing ships** - "a group of ships that travel on the ocean"
  * **along with the fleet of Hiram** - "along with Hiram's fleet of ships"
  * **apes and baboons** - It is not certain whether the word translated as "apes" here refers to apes, baboons, or monkeys. It is not certain whether the word translated as "baboons" here refers to baboons or peacocks. This can be translated more generally as "animals from far away" or "animals from Africa." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
