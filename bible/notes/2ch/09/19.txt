\v 19 Twelve lions stood on the steps, one on each side of each of the six steps. There was no throne like it in any other kingdom.
\v 20 All King Solomon's drinking cups were gold, and all the drinking cups in the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were silver because silver was not considered valuable in Solomon's days.
\v 21 The king had at sea a fleet of oceangoing ships, along with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet brought gold, silver, and ivory, as well as apes and baboons.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **silver was not considered valuable in Solomon's days** - Silver was so common in Solomon's days that it had very little value. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **apes and baboons** - Animals from very far away, likely Africa.
