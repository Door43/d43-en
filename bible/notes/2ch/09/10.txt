\v 10 The servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum wood and precious stones.
\v 11 With the algum wood, the king made steps for the house of Yahweh and for his house, as well as harps and
lyres for the musicians. No wood like this had been seen before in the land of Judah.
\v 12 King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba everything she wished for, whatever she asked, in addition to that which she had brought to the king. So she left and went back to her own land, she and her servants.
