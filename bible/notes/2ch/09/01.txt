\v 1 When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She came with a very long caravan, with camels loaded with spices, much gold, and many precious gemstones. When she had come to Solomon, she told him all that was in her heart.
\v 2 Solomon answered her all her questions; nothing was too difficult for Solomon; there was no question that he did not answer.
