\v 3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
\v 4 and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, his
cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.
\v 3 Solomon answered all her questions. There was not anything that she asked that the king did not answer.
\v 4 When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the temple that he had built,
\v 5 and the food of his table and the service of his servants and the attendance of his officials and their robes, and his cupbearers and the manner by which he offered burnt offerings in the temple of Yahweh, he took her breath away (or, her spirit was overwhelmed).
