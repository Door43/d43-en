===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When the queen of Sheba saw Solomon's wisdom and the palace that he had built** - Here "saw Solomon's wisdom" represents realizing that Solomon was very wise. AT: "When the queen of Sheba realized how wise Solomon was, and when she saw the palace that he had built" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the palace that he had built** - The author writes about Solomon having his workers build his palace as if he himself had built it. AT: "the palace that Solomon had his workers build" or "the palace that he had commanded his workers to build" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the seating of his servants** - Possible meanings are 1) where his servants lived or 2) how his servants sat around the table. 
  * **his cupbearers** - "his wine servers." These were servants who tasted the king's wine to make sure that there was no poison in it. If it was safe to drink the wine, they would give it to the king. 
  * **there was no more spirit in her** - This is an idiom. AT: "she was completely amazed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
