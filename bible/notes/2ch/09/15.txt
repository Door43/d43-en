===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Six hundred shekels of gold went into each one.** - AT: "They were made of six hundred shekels of gold."
    * **shekels... minas** - (See: [[:En:obe:other:biblicalweight]])
    * **the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon** - This was likely a storage place near the palace made of many large pieces of wood from Lebanon. This could also be called an armory.
