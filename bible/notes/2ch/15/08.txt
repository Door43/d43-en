\v 8 Asa was encouraged when he heard what Azariah son of Oded, prophesied. Asa commanded his workers to remove all the detestable idols from everywhere in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and from the towns that his soldiers had captured in the hills of the tribe of Ephraim. Asa's workers repaired the altar where people offered sacrifices to Yahweh that was in front of the entrance to the temple in Jerusalem.
\v 9 He gathered together all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin and many people had come from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were living among them. He was able to do that because many people had left those tribes in Israel, when they realized that Yahweh was helping him.

\v 8 When Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage and drove away the disgusting things from all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities that he had captured from the hill country of Ephraim, and he rebuilt Yahweh's altar, which was in front of the portico of Yahweh's house.
\v 9 He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who stayed with them—people from of Ephraim and Manasseh, and from Simeon. For they came from Israel to him in great numbers, when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Oded the prophet** - "When Asa heard the words that Oded the prophet spoke" or "When Asa heard the prophecy of Oded the prophet." The phrase "the prophecy of Oded the prophet" defines "these words."
  * **the prophecy of Oded the prophet** - Many versions, including the UDB, make this passage read, "the prophecy of Azariah, the son of Oded the prophet." They do this in order to make the sense agree with [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:15:01|15:1]]. Translators will probably want to do the same in their versions.
  * **drove away the disgusting things** - The words "the disgusting things" refers to idols. Having his people remove or destroy the idols is spoken of as if it were driving them away. AT: "got rid of the disgusting idols" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He gathered all Judah and Benjamin** - Here the word "all" is a generalization. The phrase means that David assembled people from all over Judah and Benjamin. AT: "He gathered together people from all over Judah and Benjamin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **For they came from Israel** - "For people from of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon came from Israel"
