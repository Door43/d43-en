\v 16 He also removed Maacah, his grandmother, from being queen, because she had made a disgusting figure out of an Asherah pole. Asa cut down the disgusting figure, ground it to dust and burned it at the brook Kidron.
\v 17 But the shrines were not taken away from Israel. Nevertheless, Asa’s heart was completely devoted all his days.
