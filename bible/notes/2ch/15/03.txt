\v 3 Now for a long period, Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without the law.
\v 4 But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.
\v 5 In those times there was no peace for him who traveled away, nor for him who traveled to here; instead, great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands.
