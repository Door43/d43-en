===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will now give you wisdom and knowledge** - This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "wisdom" and "knowledge." AT: "I will now cause you to be wise and to know many things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **So Solomon came to Jerusalem** - Here "Solomon" represents all the people with him. Also "came" can be stated as "went." AT: "So Solomon and the people with him went to Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])
  * **from before the tent of meeting** - "from the tent of meeting"
