\v 8 Solomon said to God, "You have shown great covenant faithfulness to David my father, and have made me king in his place.
\v 9 Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be carried out, for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth for their numbers.
\v 10 Now give me wisdom and knowledge, so that I may lead this people, for who can judge your people, who are so many in number?”
\v 11 God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and because you have not asked for riches, wealth, or honor, nor for the death of those who hate you, nor for long life for yourself—but because you have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, so that you might rule my people, over whom I have made you king—
