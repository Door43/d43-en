But \add when Solomon became the king\add*, the first Sacred Tent was still at Gibeon \add city\add*. That was the tent that Moses, the man who served God \add well\add*, had \add arranged\add* to be made in the desert. And the bronze altar that Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, had made was also still in Gibeon, in front of the first Sacred Tent.
\p \add One day\add* Solomon summoned the army commanders of 1,000 soldiers and the commanders of 100 soldiers and the judges and all the other leaders in Israel.

\v 2-5 When David had been king, he arranged for a new sacred tent to be made in Jerusalem. Then David and the Israelite leaders brought God's sacred chest from the city of Kiriath Jearim to the new sacred tent. But when Solomon became the king, the first sacred tent was still in the city of Gibeon. There was a bronze altar there that Bezalel son of Uri and grandson of Hur, had made was also still at Gibeon, in front of the first sacred tent.
\p Solomon called together the army commanders who directed thousands of soldiers, and the commanders who directed hundreds of soldiers, with the judges and all the other leaders in Israel. He told them to go with him to Gibeon. So they all went to the place on the hill where idols were worshiped at Gibeon. That was the same place where God had met with his people in the tent which Moses had made. There Solomon and all the others with him prayed to Yahweh.

\v 2 Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' houses.
\v 3 So Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh, had made in the wilderness.
\v 4 But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place that he had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
\v 5 In addition, the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh; Solomon and the assembly went to it.
\f + \ft Some older versions have, \fqa the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, he placed there before the tabernacle of Yahweh \fqa* , where \fqa he \fqa* refers to David. \f*

===== translationNotes: =====
  * **General Information:** - It may be helpful to reorder the events in these verses as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_events]])

  * **spoke to all Israel, to the commanders ... heads of the fathers' house** - Here "all of Israel" means those people mentioned afterwards. They represent all of Israel. AT: "spoke to the commanders ... heads of the father's house"
  * **the commanders of thousands and of hundreds** - Possible meanings are 1) these numbers represent the exact amount of soldiers that these commanders led. AT: "the commanders of 1,000 soldiers and the commanders of 100 soldiers" or 2) the words translated as "thousands" and "hundreds" do not represent exact numbers, but are the names of larger and smaller military divisions. AT: "the commanders of large military divisions and the commanders of smaller military divisions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' houses** - Here "the heads of the fathers' houses" further describe the princes. AT: "to every prince in all Israel, that is, the heads of the fathers' houses"
  * **to every prince** - Here "prince" means leaders in general. They are not necessarily the sons of the king. AT: "to every leader"
  * **the heads of the fathers' houses** - Here "heads" is a metaphor for the most important part. And "houses" represents families. AT: "the leaders of the families in Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Kiriath Jearim** - A little town about 9 miles west of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **pitched a tent** - "set up a tent"
  * **the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri son Hur made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
