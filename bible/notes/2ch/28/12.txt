\v 12 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
\v 13 and said to them, You shall not bring in the captives hither: for you purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add to our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
