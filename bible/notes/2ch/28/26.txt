===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all his ways, first and last** - Ahaz's actions are spoken of as if they were a path upon which he walked. The phrase "first and last" refers to those extremes and everything in between. AT: "all that he did from the beginning of his reign to the end of his reign" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **see** - "indeed." The word "see" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **they are written in the book** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone has written them in the book" or "you can read of them in the book" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the book of the kings of Judah and Israel** - This is a book that no longer exists.
  * **Ahaz slept with his ancestors** - Ahaz dying is spoken of as if he had fallen asleep. AT: "Ahaz died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **they buried him** - "people buried him"
  * **became king in his place** - The phrase "in his place" is a metaphor meaning "instead of him." AT: "became king instead of Ahaz" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
