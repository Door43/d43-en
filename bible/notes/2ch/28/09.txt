\v 9 But a prophet of Yahweh, whose name was Obed, was in Samaria. He went out of the city to meet the army as it was returning. He said to them, "Yahweh, the God to whom your ancestors belongs, was angry with the people of Judah, so he has handed them over to you, and you have slaughtered so many in a towering rage.
\v 10 And now you want to sin by causing men and women from Judah to become your slaves, but you have certainly offended Yahweh, our God, in this matter.
\v 11 So listen to me! Send back to Judah your fellow countrymen whom you have captured, because Yahweh is extremely angry with you for what you did to them."

\v 9 But a prophet of Yahweh was there, his name was Oded. He went out to meet the army coming into Samaria. He said to them, “Because Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reached up to heaven.
\v 10 And now you intend to keep the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem as your slaves. But are you not guilty of sins of your own against Yahweh, your God?
\v 11 Now then, listen to me: send the prisoners back, those whom you have taken of your own brothers, for Yahweh’s fierce wrath is on you.”
