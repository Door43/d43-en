\v 9 But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.
\v 10 And now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen to you: but are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?
\v 11 Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.
