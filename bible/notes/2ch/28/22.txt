\v 22 This same king Ahaz sinned even more against Yahweh in his time of suffering.
\v 23 For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, gods that had defeated him. He said, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, will I sacrifice to them, so that they might help me.” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.
