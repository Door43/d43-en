\v 19 For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz, king of Israel; for he had acted wickedly in Judah and had sinned against Yahweh very heavily.
\v 20 Tilgath Pileser, king of Assyria, came to him and troubled him instead of strengthening him.
\v 21 For Ahaz plundered the house of Yahweh and the houses of the king and the leaders, to give the valuable things to the kings of Assyriaâ€”but this did not benefit him.
