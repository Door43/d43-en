  * **he made ... he overlaid ... He placed** - Here "he" refers to Solomon. The readers should understand that Solomon probably commanded other people to do the actual work. AT: "Solomon's workers made ... they overlaid ... They placed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the great court** - "the large court"
  * **the house** - "the temple"
