\v 9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?
And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give you much more than this.
\v 10 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore
their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.
