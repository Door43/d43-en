\v 9 Amaziah said to the man of God, "But what will we do about the one hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel?" The man of God answered, "Yahweh is able to give you much more than that."
\v 10 So Amaziah separated the army that had come to him from Ephraim; he sent them home again. So their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **one hundred talents** - You may convert this to a modern measure. AT: "about thirty-three hundred kilograms of silver" or "about 3,300 kilograms of silver" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **the army of Israel ... the army that had come to him from Ephraim** - These are two ways to describe the same army.
  * **So their anger was greatly kindled** - Here the increase in their anger is spoken of as if it were a growing fire inside them. AT: "So their anger began to burn within them like a fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in fierce anger** - "very angry"
