\v 3 It came about that as soon as his rule was well established, he killed the servants who had murdered his father, the king.
\v 4 But he did not put the children of the murderers to death, but acted according to what was written in the law, in the book of Moses, as Yahweh had commanded, “The fathers must not die for the children, nor must the children die for the fathers. Instead, every person must die for his own sin.”
