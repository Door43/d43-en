\v 7 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is not with
Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.
\v 8 But if you will go, do valiantly, be strong for the battle: God will cast you down before the enemy; for God
has power to help, and to cast down.
