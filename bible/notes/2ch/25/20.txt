\v 20 But Amaziah would not listen; for this event was from God, so that he might deliver the people of Judah into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
\v 21 So Jehoash, king of Israel, attacked; and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, looked at each other in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\v 22 Judah was struck down before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
