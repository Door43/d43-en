\v 20 But Amaziah refused to heed Jehoash's message. That happened because God wanted Jehoash's army to defeat them, because they were worshiping the gods of Edom.
\v 21 So Jehoash's army attacked. Their two armies faced each other at Beth-Shemesh \add city\add* in Judah.
\v 22 The army of Judah was badly defeated by the army of Israel, and all the soldiers of Judah fled to their homes.

\v 20 But Amaziah would not listen, because this event was from God, so he might hand over the people of Judah into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought advice from the gods of Edom.
\v 21 So Jehoash, king of Israel, attacked; he and Amaziah, king of Judah, met each other face to face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\v 22 Judah was struck down before Israel, and every man fled home.
