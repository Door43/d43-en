\v 20 But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand
of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
\v 21 So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which
belongs to Judah.
\v 22 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.
