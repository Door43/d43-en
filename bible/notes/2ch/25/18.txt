\v 18 But Jehoash replied this to King Amaziah: "One time a thistle growing \add in the mountains\add* in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree, saying 'Give your daughter to my son in order that he can marry her.' But a wild animal in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle under his feet.
\v 19 \add The meaning of what I am say is that\add* you are saying to yourself that your army has defeated the army of Edom, so you have become very proud \f + \ft doublet \f*. But you should stay at your home. It would not be good \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for you to cause trouble, which would result in you and your kingdom of Judah being destroyed."

\v 19 What I mean is that you are saying to yourself that your army has defeated the army of Edom, so you have become very proud. You can be proud of your victory, but you should not fight me. If you do, you will only make trouble for yourself. I will defeat you, and Judah with you."

\v 18 But Jehoash the king of Israel sent messengers back to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "A thistle that was in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for a wife,' but a wild beast in Lebanon walked by and trampled down the thistle.
\v 19 You have said, 'See, I have struck down Edom,' and your heart has lifted you up. Take pride in your victory, but stay at home, for why should you cause yourself trouble and fall, both you and Judah with you?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **A thistle that was in Lebanon ... trampled down the thistle** - This message is in the form of a parable. The worthless thistle represents Amaziah, and the cedar represents Jehoash. The trampling of the thistle by the beast expresses that something bad will happen to the thistle, and it will be powerless to stop it. The point of the parable is that Amaziah was foolish to challenge Jehoash. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])
  * **thistle** - This is a small, worthless plant with small, sharp thorns. 
  * **cedar** - a very large type of tree 
  * **your heart has lifted you up** - This is an idiom that means he had become proud. AT: "you have become proud" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **why should you cause yourself trouble and fall, both you and Judah with you?** - Jehoash used this rhetorical question to warn Amaziah not to fight with him. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "you should not cause yourself trouble and fall, both you and Judah with you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **fall** - Here "fall" is a euphemism for "die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Judah** - Here "Judah" is a metonym for the people who lived in Judah. AT: "the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
