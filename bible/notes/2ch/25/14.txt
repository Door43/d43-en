\v 14 Now it came about, after that Amaziah had returned from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the people of Seir, and set them up to be his own gods. He bowed down before them and burned incense to them.
\v 15 So Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Amaziah. He sent a prophet to him, who said, “Why have
you sought after the gods of a people who did not even save their own people from your hand?”
