  * **Shemaiah** - This is the name of a man. Translate this word as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:11:02|11:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **so I have also given you over into Shishak's hand** - Here the word "hand" represents power. Yahweh speaks of enabling Shishak's army to defeat the king and the others in Jerusalem as if he were placing them into Shishak's hand. AT: "so I have enabled Shishak to defeat you" or "so I have given you to Shishak as captives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
