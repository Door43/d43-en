\v 15 As for the other matters concerning Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the writings of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, which also have records of genealogies and the constant wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
\v 16 Rehoboam slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David; Abijah his son became king in his place.
