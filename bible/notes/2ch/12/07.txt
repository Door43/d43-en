\v 7 When Yahweh saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, "They have humbled themselves. I will not ruin them; I will rescue them to some extent, and my anger will not pour out on Jerusalem by means of Shishak's hand.
\v 8 Nevertheless, they will be his servants, so that they may understand what it is to serve me and to serve the rulers of the other countries."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they had humbled themselves** - "the princes of Israel and the king had humbled themselves"
  * **the word of Yahweh came ... saying** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message ... and he said" or "Yahweh spoke these words ... and he said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will rescue them to some extent** - Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh will permit Shishak to attack Jerusalem and cause trouble for the people, but he will rescue them from total destruction or 2) the words "to some extent" can be translated as soon, meaning that Yahweh will rescue the people of Jerusalem before Shishak can completely destroy the city.
  * **my anger will not pour out on Jerusalem** - Yahweh speaks of his anger as if it were a liquid, and of expressing his anger as if he were to pour out that liquid. AT: "I will not express my anger against Jerusalem" or "Jerusalem will not suffer the effects of my anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by means of Shishak's hand** - Here the word "hand" represents Shishak himself. AT: "by means of Shishak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
