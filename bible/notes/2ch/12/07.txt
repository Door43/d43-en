\v 7 When Yahweh saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah; it said, "They have humbled themselves. I will not ruin them; I will rescue them to some extent, and my anger will not pour out on Jerusalem by means of Shishak's hand.
\v 8 Nevertheless, they will be his servants, so that they may understand what it is to serve me and to serve the rulers of the other countries."
