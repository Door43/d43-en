\v 13 So king Rehoboam made his kingship strong in Jerusalem, and thus he reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that Yahweh had chosen from all the tribes of Israel so that he might put his name there. His motherâ€™s name was Naamah, the Ammonitess.
\v 14 He did what was evil, because he did not fix his heart to seek Yahweh.
