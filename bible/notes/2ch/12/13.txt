\v 13 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began
to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to
put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
\v 14 And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek Jehovah.
