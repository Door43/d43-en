\v 6 For our ancestors trespassed and did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God; they forsook him, turned away their faces from the place where Yahweh lives, and turned their backs on it.
\v 7 Also they shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps; they did not burn incense or offer
burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
