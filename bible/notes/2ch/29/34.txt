====== 2 Chronicles 29:34 ======

<usfm>
\v 34 But there were not enough priests to remove the skins from the animals that would be completely burned \add on the altar\add*. So their fellow descendants of Levi helped them until that work was finished, and until other priests had purified\f + \ft Or: consecrated \f* themselves to do that work. It was necessary for them to do that because many of the priests had not performed the rituals to purify\f + \ft Or: consecrate \f* themselves for that work, like the descendants of Levi had done.

\v 34 There were not enough priests to remove the skins from the animals that would be completely burned on the altar. So their fellow descendants of Levi helped them until that work was finished, and until other priests had set themselves apart for the work of honoring Yahweh,  themselves for that work, like the descendants of Levi had also set themselves apart to honor Yahweh.

\v 34 But the priests were too few to skin all the burnt offerings, so their brothers, the Levites, helped them until the work was done, and until the priests had consecrated themselves; for the Levites were more careful to consecrate  themselves than the priests were.
