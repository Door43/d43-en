====== 2 Chronicles 29:34 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 But there were not enough priests to remove the skins from the animals that would be completely burned \add on the altar\add*. So their fellow descendants of Levi helped them until that work was finished, and until other priests had purified\f + \ft Or: consecrated \f* themselves to do that work. It was necessary for them to do that because many of the priests had not performed the rituals to purify\f + \ft Or: consecrate \f* themselves for that work, like the descendants of Levi had done.

\v 34 There were not enough priests to remove the skins from the animals that would be completely burned on the altar. So the descendants of Levi stepped in to helped the priests until the work was finished. The Levites were more hard-working and dedicated that the priests were.

\v 34 But the priests were too few to skin all the burnt offerings, so their brothers, the Levites, helped them until the work was done, and until the priests could consecrate themselves, for the Levites had been more careful to consecrate themselves than the priests.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to skin all the burnt offerings** - "to remove the skins from all the burn offerings"
  * **until the work was done** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "until they had finished the work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **until the priests could consecrate themselves** - Since there were some priests who were already consecrated, this implies that more priests consecrated themselves. AT: "until more of the priests could consecrate themselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **had been more careful to consecrate themselves** - There were enough Levites to do this work because they had been careful to consecrate themselves. This implies that the reason that there were not enough priests was because the priests were not careful to consecrate themselves.
