\v 15 They gathered their brothers, dedicated themselves to Yahweh, and went in, as the king commanded, following the words of Yahweh, to cleanse the house of Yahweh.
\v 16 The priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh to cleanse it; they brought out all the filth that they found in the temple of Yahweh into the courtyard of the house. The Levites took it to carry it out to the brook Kidron.
\v 17 Now they began on the first day of the first month to dedicate the house to Yahweh, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Yahweh. They dedicated the house of Yahweh in eight days. On the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.
