\v 16 They stood in their place by their divisions, following the directions given in the Law of Moses, the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites.
\v 17 For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves, so the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for everyone who was not purified, in order to consecrate the lambs to Yahweh.
