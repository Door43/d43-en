<usfm>
\v 7 Do not act like they did, because what they did caused Yahweh to punish them so severely that other people were horrified when they heard of what he had done.
\v 8 Do not be stubborn as our ancestors were. Do what Yahweh desires. Come to Jerusalem to the temple, which he has set apart for his honor forever. Do what pleases Yahweh our God, in order that he will no longer be angry with you.
\v 9 If you return to Yahweh, the people who have captured our brothers and sisters and our children will act kindly toward them, and allow them to return to this land. Do not forget that Yahweh our God is kind and merciful. If you return to him, he will no longer reject you."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Do not be like your ancestors or your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, so that he gave them up to destruction, as you see.
\v 8 Now do not be stubborn, as your ancestors were; instead, give yourselves to Yahweh and come into his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever, and worship Yahweh, your God, so that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
\v 9 For if you turn back to Yahweh, your brothers and children will find compassion before those who led them away as prisoners, and they will come back into this land. For Yahweh, your God, is gracious and merciful, and will not turn his face away from you, if you return to him."
