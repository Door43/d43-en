\v 19 who sincerely wants to honor you, the God whom our ancestors \add worshiped\add*, even if they have not purified themselves by obeying the sacred laws that you gave to us."

\v 18 For a great many of the people, many of them from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover meal, against the written instructions. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good Yahweh pardon everyone
\v 19 who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his ancestors, even though he is not purified by the purification standards of the sanctuary.”
\v 20 So Yahweh listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.
