\v 1-3 King Hezekiah, his officials, and all the other people who had gathered in Jerusalem wanted to celebrate the Passover festival. But they were not able to celebrate it at the usual time, because many of the priests had still not been able to perform all the rites of purity for themselves, so they were not allowed to do the work of that festival. Also, not everyone had come to Jerusalem to celebrate it. So they decided to celebrate the festival the following month.

\v 1 Hezekiah sent messengers to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem, to celebrate the Passover for Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 2 For the king, his leaders, and all the assembly in Jerusalem had consulted together, deciding to celebrate the passover in the second month.
\v 3 They could not celebrate it right away, because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people gathered together in Jerusalem.
