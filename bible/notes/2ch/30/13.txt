\v 13 So a huge crowd of people gathered in Jerusalem in May, to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
\v 14 They removed the altars of Baal in Jerusalem and took away the altars for burning incense to honor other gods; they burned them all in the Kidron Valley.
\p
\v 15 They slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of that month. The priests and the other descendants of Levi who had not performed the rituals to purify themselves, they were ashamed; and they set about to make themselves qualified for the service to Yahweh, and they brought to the temple animals to be completely burned on the altar in the house of Yahweh.

\v 13 Many people, a very great assembly, gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
\v 14 They rose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense; they threw them into the brook Kidron.
\v 15 Then they killed the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed, and they consecrated themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh.
