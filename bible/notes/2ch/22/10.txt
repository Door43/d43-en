\v 10 Now when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she arose and killed  all the royal children in the house of Judah.
\v 11 But Jehoshaba, a daughter of the king, took Joash, a son of Ahaziah, and spirited him away from among the king's sons who were killed. She put him and his nurse into a bedroom. So Jehoshaba, a daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that Athaliah did not kill him.
\v 12 He was with them, hidden in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
