\v 10 Now when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she arose and killed all the royal children in the house of Judah.
\v 11 But Jehosheba, \f + \ft \fqa Jehosheba \fqa* may be spelled \fqa Jehoshaba \fqa* in some versions. \f* a daughter of the king, secretly took Joash son of Ahaziah away from the king's sons who were about to be killed. She put him and his nurse into a bedroom. So Jehosheba, a daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that Athaliah did not kill him.
\v 12 He was with them, hidden in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **she arose and killed all the royal children** - Here the writer speaks of Athaliah as if she killed the children herself, but the reader should understand that she would have ordered her servants to kill them. AT: "she commanded her servants to kill all the royal children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all the royal children** - This refers only to the males, because they could become king. Verse 11 confirms that the sons were the ones who were killed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the house of Judah** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case, it refers to the kingdom of Judah. AT: "Judah" or "the kingdom of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Jehosheba, a daughter of the king ... a daughter of King Jehoram** - Here "the king" refers to Jehoram, the father of Ahaziah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **his nurse** - This refers to a person who cares for a child, not to a medical person. 
  * **into a bedroom** - Verse 12 makes it clear that this bedroom was located in the temple. Jehosheba could access that room because she was married to Jehoiada who was a priest.
  * **Jehoiada** - This is a man's name. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) 
  * **He was with them** - "Joash was with Jehosheba and Jehoiada"
