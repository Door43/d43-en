\v 6 But no one can \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* really build a temple that would be big enough for God \add to live in\add*, because he is bigger than even the highest skies\f + \ft Or: heavens \f*. And I am worthy only \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* to build a place where we can burn sacrifices to him.

\v 7 Therefore, please send me a man who knows well how to make things from gold and silver and bronze and iron, and to make things from purple and red and blue cloth. He should also know well how to engrave designs. I want him to work in Jerusalem and in other places in Judah with my skilled craftsmen, the ones whom my father David appointed.

\v 7 Therefore, please send me someone who is very good at making things from gold and silver and bronze and iron, and at making things from purple and red and blue cloth.

<usfm>
\v 6 But who is able to build God a house, since the entire universe and even heaven itself cannot contain him? Who am I to build him a house, except to burn sacrifices before him?
\v 7 So send me a man who is skilled at work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue wool, a man who knows how to make all kinds of engraved wood. He will be with the skilled men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.

  * **who is able to build God a house, since the entire universe and even heaven itself cannot contain him? Who am I to build him a house, except to burn sacrifices before him?** - Solomon uses a question to emphasize that no one is able or worthy to build a house for God. AT: "no one is able to build a house for God because not even the universe or heaven is big enough to contain him. I am not worthy to build a house for him, except as a place to offer sacrifices to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
