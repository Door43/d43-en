\v 6 But who is able to build God a house, since the entire universe and even heaven itself cannot contain him? Who am I to build him a house, except to burn sacrifices before him?
\v 7 So send me a man who is skilled at work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, and in purple, crimson,
and blue wool, a man who knows how to make all kinds of engraved word. He will be with the skilled men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
