\v 4 We are about to build a temple to set it apart for Yahweh, to burn for him incense made from fragrant spices, to always display before him the bread, and to burn animal offerings every morning and evening and day of rest, as well as at every new moon and on the other special festivals to honor Yahweh our God. We want to do these things forever, as Yahweh has commanded.

\v 4 See, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to set it apart to him, to burn incense of sweet spices before him, to set out the bread of the presence, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths and on the new moons, and on the appointed feasts for Yahweh our God. This is forever, for Israel.
\v 5 The house that I will build will be very large, for our God is greater than all other gods.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God** - Here "name" represents the person. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "I am about to build a house where Yahweh my God may live" or "I am about to build a house where people may worship Yahweh my God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am about to build** - Solomon would command his people to build the house. AT: "I am about to command my people to build" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the bread of the presence** - This is a reference to the 12 loaves of bread that were placed in front of the altar.
  * **new moons** - This was the time of a festival coinciding with the movement of the moon.
  * **This is forever, for Israel** - Here "This" refers back to all the ways the people will worship Yahweh at his temple. AT: "These are the things Yahweh has commanded Israel to do forever" 
  * **God is greater** - This is a reference to God being more important and more powerful than other gods, not to being larger than other gods.
