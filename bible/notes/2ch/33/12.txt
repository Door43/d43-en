===== translationNotes: =====

  * **implored** - to beg for help
  * **He prayed to him; and God was begged by him** - The second phrase intensifies the first phrase and emphasizes the earnestness of Manasseh's prayer. This can be stated in active form. AT: "He prayed to God and begged him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **into his kingship** - "to rule again as king"
