\v 14 After this, Manasseh built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, to the
entrance at the Fish Gate. He surrounded the hill of Ophel with
it and raised the wall up to a very great height. He put courageous commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.
\v 15 He took away the foreign gods, the idol out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had built on the
mount of the house of Yahweh and in Jerusalem, and threw them out of the city.
