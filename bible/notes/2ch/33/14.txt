\v 14 Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the
entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about with
it, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.
\v 15 And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the
mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
