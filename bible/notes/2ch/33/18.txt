\v 18 As to the other matters concerning Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the deeds of the kings of Israel.
\v 19 His prayer also, and how God was begged by him, all his sin and his trespasses, and the places where he had built shrines and set up the Asherah poles and the carved figures, before he humbled himself—they are written about in the Chronicles of the Seers.
\v 20 So Manasseh slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in his own house. Amon, his son, became king in his place.
