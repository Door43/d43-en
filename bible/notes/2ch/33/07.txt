\v 7 Manasseh took the carved idol \add that his workers had made\add* and put it in the temple. That is the temple concerning which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, "My temple will be here in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen \add where I want people to\add* worship me, forever.
\v 8 If they will obey all the laws and decrees and regulations that I gave to Moses to give to them, I will not again force the Israelite people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* to leave this land that I gave to their ancestors."
\v 9 But Manasseh led the people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah to do things that are wrong, with the result that they did more evil than was done by the people in the people-groups that Yahweh had expelled as the Israelite people advanced.

\v 7 The carved figure of Asherah that he had made, he placed it in the house of God. It was about this house that God had spoken to David and Solomon his son; he had said, "It is in this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, that I will put my name forever.
\v 8 I will not move the people of Israel any more out of the land that I assigned to their ancestors, if they will only be careful to keep all that I have commanded them, following all the law, statutes, and decrees which I gave them through Moses."
\v 9 Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do evil even more than the nations that Yahweh had destroyed before the people of Israel.
