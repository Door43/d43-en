\v 8 If they will obey all the laws and decrees and regulations that I gave to Moses to give to them, I will not again force the Israelite people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* to leave this land that I gave to their ancestors."
\v 9 But Manasseh led the people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah to do things that are wrong, with the result that they did more evil than was done by the people in the people-groups that Yahweh had expelled as the Israelite people advanced.

\v 7 And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon
his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
\v 8 neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they
will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances
given by Moses.
\v 9 And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah
destroyed before the children of Israel.
