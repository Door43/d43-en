\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became the king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for fifty-five years.
\v 2 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He imitated the disgusting things that were formerly done by the people groups that Yahweh had expelled from Israel as his people advanced into the land.
\v 3 He commanded his workers to rebuild the high places upon the hills for worshiping idols, the same ones that his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He told them to set up poles to honor the god Baal, and to make poles to honor the goddess Asherah. He also bowed down to worship all the stars.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
\v 2 He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, like the disgusting things of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out before the people of Israel.
\v 3 For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had torn down, and he built altars for the Baals, he made Asherah poles, and he bowed down to all the stars of heaven and worshiped them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **what was evil in the sight of Yahweh** - Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:14:01|14:2]]. AT: "things that Yahweh said were evil" or "the things that Yahweh considers evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **like the disgusting things** - Another possible meaning is "including the disgusting things."
  * **he rebuilt the high places ... he built altars ... he made Asherah poles** - Manasseh would have commanded his workers to do the building for him. AT: "he had the high places rebuilt ... he had altars built ... he had Asherah poles made" or "he had his workers rebuild the high places ... he had them build altars ... he had them make Asherah poles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
