\v 21 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
\v 22 And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the
graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
\v 23 And he humbled not himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more
and more.
