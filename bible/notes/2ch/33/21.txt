\v 21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
\v 22 He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as Manasseh, his father, had done. Amon sacrificed to all the carved figures that Manasseh his father had made, and he worshiped them.
\v 23 He did not humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had done. Instead, this same Amon trespassed more and more.
