\v 6 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here still another prophet of Yahweh with whom we might seek advice?"
\v 7 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man by whom we may seek the advice of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but only hardships." But Jehoshaphat said, "May the king not say that."
\v 8 Then the king of Israel called an officer and commanded, "Bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah, right away."
