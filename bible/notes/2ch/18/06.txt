\v 6 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here still another prophet of Yahweh with whom we might seek advice?"
\v 7 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man by whom we may seek the advice of Yahweh, Micaiah son of Imlah, but I hate him because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil." But Jehoshaphat said, "The king should not say that."
\v 8 Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, "Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah."
