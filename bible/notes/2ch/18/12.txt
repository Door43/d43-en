===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Micaiah** - Translate this man's name the same as in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:17:07|17:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Now look** - "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **the words of the prophets declare good things to the king with one mouth** - The prophets all saying the same thing is spoken of as if they all spoke with the same mouth. The phrase "the words of the prophets" represents the message that the prophets declare. AT: "the prophets all declare the same good things to the king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **let your word be like the word of one of them** - Here the word "them" refers to "the words of the prophets." AT: "let what you say agree with what they have said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **As Yahweh lives** - "as surely as Yahweh is alive." The people use this expression to show that what they say next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **or not** - The missing words may be added. AT: "or should we not go" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **should we go** - The word "we" refers to Ahab, Jehoshaphat, and their armies but not to Micaiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
