===== translationNotes: =====

  * **entice** - This means to attract someone by offering something appealing.
  * **fall at Ramoth Gilead** - Ahab dying in battle is spoken of as if he will fall. AT: "die at Ramoth Gilead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **One said this and another that** - This indicates that there was more than one opinion. The words "One ... and another" refer to two or more angels in the heavenly host who were responding to Yahweh's question in the previous verse.
