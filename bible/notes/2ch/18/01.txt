\v 1 Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; he allied himself with Ahab by having one of his family marry his daughter.
\v 2 After some years, he went down to Ahab in Samaria. Ahab killed many sheep and oxen for him and the
people who were with him. Ahab also persuaded him to attack Ramoth Gilead with him.
