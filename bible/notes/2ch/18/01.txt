\v 1 Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; he allied himself with Ahab by having one of his family marry his daughter.
\v 2 After some years, he went down to Ahab in Samaria. Ahab killed many sheep and oxen for him and the people who were with him. Ahab also persuaded him to attack Ramoth Gilead with him.
\v 3 Ahab, king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, "Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat answered him, "I am like you, and my people are like your people; we will be with you in the war."
