\v 1 Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; he allied himself with Ahab by having one of his family marry his daughter.
\v 2 After some years, he went down to Ahab in Samaria. Ahab killed many sheep and oxen for him and the people who were with him. Ahab also persuaded him to attack Ramoth Gilead with him.
\v 3 Ahab, king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, "Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat answered him, "I am like you, and my people are like your people. We will be with you in the war."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; he allied himself with Ahab** - The word "now" is used here to mark background information. This happened before Ahab went down to Samaria. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]]) 
  * **he allied himself with Ahab** - "he aligned himself with Ahab" or "he made himself a friend of Ahab"
  * **Ahab killed many sheep and oxen for him and the people** - This means that he had these animals slaughtered to prepare a feast for the people. Also, Ahab himself would not have prepared the animals, but rather would have commanded his workers to do it. AT: "Ahab commanded his workers to slaughter many sheep and oxen for a feast for Jehoshaphat and the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead** - Here Ahab is requesting for Jehoshaphat to join him with his army to make war against Ramoth Gilead. This can be written explicitly. Also, in this question each of the kings represents themselves accompanied by their armies. AT: "Will you and your army go with my army to attack the city of Ramoth in the region of Gilead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I am like you, and my people are like your people** - Jehoshaphat is stating his allegiance to Ahab. AT: "I offer myself and my soldiers to you to use in any way you want" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
