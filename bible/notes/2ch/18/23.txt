===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Kenaanah** - Translate this man's name the same as in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:18:09|18:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh take to go from me to speak to you?** - Zedekiah asks this sarcastic question to insult and rebuke Micaiah. AT: "Do not think that Yahweh's Spirit left me to speak to you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Look** - "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **you will know that** - "you will know the answer to your question." If Zedekiah's rhetorical question is translated as a statement, this phrase may be translated to supply implicit information. AT: "you will know that the Spirit of Yahweh has spoken to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
