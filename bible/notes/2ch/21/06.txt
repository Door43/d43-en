\v 6 But he did many of the \add evil\add* things that the kings of Israel had done. He did many things that Yahweh says are evil, things that the family \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Ahab had done, because he married one of Ahab's daughters.
\v 7 However, because of the agreement that Yahweh had made with King David, Yahweh did not want to get rid of the descendants \f + \ft metonymy \f* of David. He had promised that David's descendants would always be the ones who ruled \f + \ft metonymy \f* Judah.

\v 6 He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab was doing, for he had Ahab's daughter as his wife, and he did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 7 However, Yahweh did not wish to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David; he had promised that he would always give life to him and his descendants.
