\v 6 But he did many of the \add evil\add* things that the kings of Israel had done. He did many things that Yahweh says are evil, things that the family \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Ahab had done, because he married one of Ahab's daughters.
\v 7 However, because of the agreement that Yahweh had made with King David, Yahweh did not want to get rid of the descendants \f + \ft metonymy \f* of David. He had promised that David's descendants would always be the ones who ruled \f + \ft metonymy \f* Judah.

\v 6 He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab was doing; for he had Ahab's daughter as his wife; and he did what was evil in Yahweh's sight.
\v 7 However, Yahweh did not wish to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David; he had promised that he would always give life to him and his descendants.
