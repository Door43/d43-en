\v 12 One day, Jehoram received a letter from the prophet Elijah. Elijah had written this in the letter:
\li This is what Yahweh, the God whom your ancestor \add King\add* David \add worshiped\add*, says: "You have not done things that please me like your father Jehoshaphat did or what King Asa did.
\v 13 Instead, you have continually done the \add evil things\add* that the kings of Israel have done. You have encouraged the people in Jerusalem and other places in Judah to stop worshiping Yahweh \f + \ft metonymy \f*, like the descendants of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own \add younger\add* brothers, who were better\f + \ft Or: more righteous \f* men than you are.
\li
\v 14 So now Yahweh is about to cause disasters to strike very severely the people in your kingdom and even your own children and your wives, and everything that you own.
\v 15 And you yourself will have an intestinal disease that will continue to become worse, and you will suffer from it until you die."

\v 12 A letter from the prophet Elijah came to Jehoram. It said, "This is what Yahweh, the God of David, your ancestor, says: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat, your father, nor in the ways of Asa, king of Judah,
\v 13 but have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to act like a prostitute, as the house of Ahab didx97and because you have also killed your brothers in your father's family will the sword, men who were better than yourselfx97
\v 14 see, Yahweh will strike with a great plague your people, your children, your wives, and all your weath.
\v 15 You yourself will have much sickness because of a disease in your intestines, until your intestines fall out because of the sickness, day after day."
