\c 21
\p
\v 1 Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David; Jehoram, his son, became king in his place.
\v 2 Jehoram had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.
\v 3 Their father had given them large gifts of silver, gold, and other precious things, and also fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the throne to Jehoram, because he was his firstborn.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **slept with his ancestors** - Jehoshaphat dying is spoken of as if he had fallen asleep. AT: "died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **city of David** - This is the city of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Jehoshaphat, king of Israel** - The southern kingdom was technically called "Judah," but the writer of this book apparently wanted to make the point that the southern kingdom was, in its obedience to God, the true Israel.
  * **large gifts** - "gifts of large amounts"
  * **gave the throne to Jehoram** - Jehoshaphat decided that Jehoram should be the king after he died. Here "throne" is a metonym for ruling as king. AT: "made Jehoram king after him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
