===== translationNotes: =====

  * **stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians** - Stirring the spirit is a metonym for making someone want to act. Here "spirit" is singular and refers to the Philistines as a group and to the Arabians as a group. AT: "provoked against Jehoram the Philistines and the Arabians" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **against Jehoram** - Here Jehoram refers to Jehoram and the people of Judah that he ruled. AT: "against Jehoram and the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians** - The Philistines and the Arabians were two different nations. The Arabians lived southeast of Judah near the Ethiopians, and the Philistines lived west of Judah. These nations were stirred up separately. This can be made explicit. AT: "the spirit of the Philistines and the spirit of the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **No son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest son** - "They took away all of his sons except Jehoahaz, his youngest son" or "The only son they left to him was Jehoahaz, his youngest son" 
  * **Jehoahaz, his youngest son** - This same son is called "Ahaziah" in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:22:01|22:01]].
