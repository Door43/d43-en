\v 27 'Because you heeded \add what was written in the scroll\add*, and you humbled yourself when you heard what I said to warn \add about what would happen to\add* this city and the people who live here, and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you.
\v 28 So I will allow you to die \f + \ft euphemism \f* and be buried peacefully. I will cause a great disaster to come to this place and on the people who live here, but you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will not \add be alive to\add* see it.'~"

\v 26 But to the king of Judah, who sent you to ask Yahweh what he should do, this is what you will say to him, 'Yahweh, the God of Israel says this: About the words that you heard,
\v 27 because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and because you have humbled yourself before me and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have listened to you—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\v 28 see, I will gather you to your ancestors. You will be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes will not see any of the disaster I will bring on this place and its inhabitants.'" The men took this message back to the king.
