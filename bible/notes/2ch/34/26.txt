\v 26 But to the king of Judah, who sent you to ask Yahweh’s will, this is what you will say to him: "Yahweh, the God of Israel says this: About the words that you heard:
\v 27 'because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and because you have humbled yourself before me and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have listened to you’—this is the declaration of Yahweh.
\v 28 'See, I will gather you to your ancestors; you will be gathered to your grave in peace, nor will your eyes see
any of the disaster that I will bring on this place and its inhabitants.'"'" So the men took this message back to the king.
