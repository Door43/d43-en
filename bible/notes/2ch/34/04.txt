\v 4 While he directed them, his workers tore down the altars where people worshiped Baal. They smashed the altars that were near those altars, where people burned incense. They smashed the poles \add to honor the goddess\add* Asherah and the idols and statues. They smashed them to bits and scattered the bits over the graves of those who had offered sacrifices to them.
\v 5 They burned the bones of the priests \add who had offered sacrifices\add*; they burned them on their own altars. In that way Josiah caused Jerusalem and other places in Judah to be acceptable places to worship Yahweh again.

\v 4 And they brake down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed
down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it
upon the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.
\v 5 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
