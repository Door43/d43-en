\v 23 She said to them, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'Tell the man who sent you to me,
\v 24 "This is what Yahweh says: 'See, I am about to bring disaster on this place and on its inhabitants, all the curses that have been written in the book that they have read before the king of Judah.
\v 25 Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, so that they might provoke me to anger with all the deeds they have committed—therefore my anger will be poured out on this place, and it will not be extinguished.'"
