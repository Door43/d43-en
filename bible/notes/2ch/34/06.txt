===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He broke down the altars, beat ... cut apart** - Josiah would have commanded his workers to do these things. AT: "He commanded his workers to break down the altars, to beat ... to cut apart" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **into powder** - "into dust." This means to smash them until they have become powder.
