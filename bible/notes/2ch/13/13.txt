\v 13 But Jeroboam prepared an ambush behind them; his army was in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
\v 14 When Judah looked back, behold, the fighting was both in front of them and behind them. They cried out to Yahweh, and the priests blew the trumpets.
\v 15 Then the men of Judah gave a shout; as they shouted, it came about that God struck Jeroboam and all
Israel before Abijah and Judah.
