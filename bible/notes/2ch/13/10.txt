\v 10 But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests, descendants of Aaron,  serving Yahweh, and the Levites, who are at their work.
\v 11 Every morning and evening they burn for Yahweh burnt offerings and sweet incense. They also arrange the bread of the presence the pure table; they also tend the lampstand of gold with its lamps, for them to burn every evening. We keep the commandments of Yahweh, our God, but you have forsaken him.
