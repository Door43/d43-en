\v 7 Solomon forced people from many other groups who were not Israelites to work for him like slaves. They were people from the Heth, Amor, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus people-groups.

\v 7 As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who did not belong to Israel,
\v 8 their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed—Solomon made them into forced laborers, which they are to this day.
