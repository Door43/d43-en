\v 6 He placed military commanders over the people. He gathered them together to him in the broad place at the city gate and spoke encouragingly to them. He said,
\v 7 “Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and all the army  that is with him, for someone is with us who is greater than those with him.
\v 8 With him is only an arm of flesh, but with us is Yahweh, our God, to help us, and to fight our battles.” Then the people comforted themselves with the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah.
