<usfm>
\v 13-14 Do you people not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the people-groups in other countries? \add We destroyed them all, and\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* none of the gods of those nations were ever able to prevent my \add troops\add* [IDI] from conquering them! So how can \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* your god prevent my soldiers from conquering \f + \ft metonymy \f* you?
\v 15 So do not allow Hezekiah to deceive you like this. Do not believe what he says, because no god of any nation or kingdom has ever been able to rescue his people from being conquered by my army and the armies of my ancestors. So certainly your god will not be able to rescue you from my power \f + \ft metonymy \f*."

\v 13-14 Do you people not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the people groups in other countries? We destroyed them all, and their gods could not save them from me.
\v 15 So do not allow Hezekiah to deceive you like this. Do not believe what he says, because no god of any nation or kingdom has ever been able to rescue his people from being conquered by my army and the armies of my ancestors. So certainly your god will not be able to rescue you from my power."

<usfm>
\v 13 Do you not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the people groups of other lands? Were the gods of the people groups of the lands able in any way to rescue their land from my power?
\v 14 Among all the gods of those nations that my ancestors completely destroyed, was there any god who could rescue his people out of my hand? Why should your God be able to rescue you from my power?
\v 15 Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you in this way. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to rescue his people out of my hand, or out of the hand of my ancestors. How much less will your God rescue you from my hand?'"
