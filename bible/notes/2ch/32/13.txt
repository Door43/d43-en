\v 13-14 Do you people not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the people-groups in other countries? \add We destroyed them all, and\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* none of the gods of those nations were ever able to prevent my \add troops\add* [IDI] from conquering them! So how can \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* your god prevent my soldiers from conquering \f + \ft metonymy \f* you?
\v 15 So do not allow Hezekiah to deceive you like this. Do not believe what he says, because no god of any nation or kingdom has ever been able to rescue his people from being conquered by my army and the armies of my ancestors. So certainly your god will not be able to rescue you from my power \f + \ft metonymy \f*."

\v 13-14 Do you people not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the people-groups in other countries? We destroyed them all, and their gods could not save them from me.
\v 15 So do not allow Hezekiah to deceive you like this. Do not believe what he says, because no god of any nation or kingdom has ever been able to rescue his people from being conquered by my army and the armies of my ancestors. So certainly your god will not be able to rescue you from my power."

\v 13 Do you not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the peoples of the lands able in any way to deliver their land out of my hand?
\v 14 Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my ancestors completely destroyed, who could deliver his people out of my hand? Why should your God be able to deliver you out of my hand?
\v 15 Now then, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you in this way. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people out of my hand, or out of the hand of my ancestors. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?”
