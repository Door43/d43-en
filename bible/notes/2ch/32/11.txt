\v 11 Is not Hezekiah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, "Yahweh our God will rescue us from the hand of the king of Assyria"?
\v 12 Has not this same Hezekiah  taken away his shrines and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, "On one altar you will worship, and on it you will burn your sacrifices?"
