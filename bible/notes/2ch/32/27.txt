\v 27 Hezekiah had very many riches and much honor. He provided himself with storerooms for silver, gold, precious stones, and for spices, as well as for shields and for all kinds of valuable objects.
\v 28 He also had storehouses for the harvest of grain, new wine, and oil, and stalls for all kinds of animals. He also had flocks in their pens.
\v 29 In addition, he provided himself with cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very much wealth.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa cities \fqa* , some modern versions have \fqa donkeys \fqa* , and some other modern versions leave out the word entirely. \f*
