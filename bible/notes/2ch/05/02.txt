===== translationNotes: =====

  * **assembled the elders of Israel** - "called together the leaders of Israel"
  * **all the heads of the tribes** - Here "heads" is a metaphor for the most important part of something. AT: "all the leaders of the tribes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **All the men of Israel** - This may refer either 1) to the people whom Solomon called to Jerusalem and who are listed in 5:2 or 2) generally to those who traveled to Jerusalem for the feast, not necessarily to every male person who lived in Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **at the feast, which was in the seventh month** - This is the Festival of Shelters which is on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. This is near the beginning of October on Western calendars. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
