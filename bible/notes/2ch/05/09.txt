\v 9 The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the most holy place, but they could not be seen from outside. They are there to this day.
\v 10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
