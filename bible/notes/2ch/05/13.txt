\v 13 It came about that the trumpeters and singers made music together, making one sound to be heard for praising and thanking Yahweh. They raised their voices with the trumpets and cymbals and other instruments, and they praised Yahweh. They sang, “For he is good, for his covenant loyalty endures forever.” Then the house, the house of Yahweh, was filled with a cloud.
\v 14 The priests could not stand in order to serve because of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled his house.
