\v 13 it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking
Yahweh ; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh,
saying, For he is good; for his lovingkindness endures for ever; that then the house was filled with a
cloud, even the house of Jehovah,
\v 14 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God.
\v 11 The priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled the temple of Yahweh.
