\v 1 Now when all this was finished, all the people of Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke to pieces the sacred stone pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and broke down the shrines and the altars in all of Judah and Benjamin. They also did this in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the people of Israel returned, every man to his own land and to his own city.
