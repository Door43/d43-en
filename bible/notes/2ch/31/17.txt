\v 17 They gave to those who were counted in the genealogies of their ancestral houses, and to the Levites twenty years old and up, filling their positions division by division.
\v 18 They gave to those—counted in their genealogies—who were all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, through all the whole of the people—for they consecrated themselves in a holy manner for their positions of trust.
\v 19 For the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who were in the fields of the villages belonging to their cities, or in every city, there were men assigned by name to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were counted in the genealogies as being among the Levites.
