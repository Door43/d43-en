===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Throughout chapter 23, Joash is referred to as "the king." It may be helpful to your readers to occasionally add "King Joash" or "Joash the king" to make his identity explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

  * **all the people went to the house of Baal** - This is a generalization that means a large group of the people did this. AT: "a very large group of the people went to the temple of Baal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Mattan** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
