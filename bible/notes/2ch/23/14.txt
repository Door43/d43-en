\v 14 Then Jehoiada, the priest, brought out the commanders of hundreds who were over the army and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; anyone who follows her, let him be killed with the sword.” For the priest had said, “Do not kill her in the house of Yahweh.”
\v 15 So they made way for her, and she went by way of the Horse Gate to the king’s house, and there they killed her.
