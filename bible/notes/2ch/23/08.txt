\v 8 So the Levites and all Judah served in every way in the manner in which Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each one took his men, those who were to come in to serve on the Sabbath, and those who were to leave off serving on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed any of their divisions.
\v 9 Then Jehoiada the priest brought to the commanders spears and small and large shields that had been King David's that were in the house of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all Judah** - This is a generalization to refer to all the people of Judah who were present in the courtyard that day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **served in every way in the manner in which Jehoiada the priest commanded** - "did exactly what Jehoiada the priest commanded" or "obeyed everything that Jehoiada the priest commanded"
  * **Each one took his men ... any of their divisions** - The priests and guards served in divisions, with each group working for two weeks. This refers to the point in time when two divisions were present—the one ending their service and the one starting their service. Thus there were twice as many men as usual. 
  * **were to leave off serving on the Sabbath** - "were finishing their work on that Sabbath day"
