\v 8 So the Levites and all Judah served in every way in the manner in which Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each one took his men, those who were to come in to serve on the Sabbath, and those who were to leave off serving on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada, the priest, had not dismissed any of their divisions.
\v 9 Then Jehoiada, the priest, brought to the commanders spears, and small and large shields, that had been King David’s, which were in the house of God.
