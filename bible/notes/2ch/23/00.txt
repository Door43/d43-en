The chapter ends the story of Queen Athaliah and begins the story of King Joash.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Having a king ==
The high priest organized a coup and made seven-year-old Joash king. Athaliah objected, so the chief priest had her killed. This was an attempt by the priests to fulfill the covenant God made with David. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:highpriest]], [[:en:obe:kt:priest]] [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])
