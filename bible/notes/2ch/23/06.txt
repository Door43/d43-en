\v 6 Allow no one to come into the house of Yahweh, except for the priests and the Levites who are serving; they must come in, for they are reserved for their tasks today. All of them must keep the commands of Yahweh.
\v 7 The Levites must surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever comes into the house, let him be killed. Stay with the king when he comes in and when he goes out."
