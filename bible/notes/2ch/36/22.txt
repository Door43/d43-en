\v 22 During the first year that Cyrus was the king of Persia, in order that what Yahweh told Jeremiah would happen would occur, Yahweh motivated [IDI] Cyrus to write this and proclaim it throughout his kingdom:
\p
\v 23 "I, Cyrus, the king of Persia, declare that Yahweh, the God \add who rules\add* in heaven, has enabled me to become the ruler of all the kingdoms of this world. And he has appointed me to command that my workers build a temple \f + \ft Or:a temple be built \f* for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

\v 22 Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, so that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be carried out, Yahweh motivated the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing. He said,
\v 23 "This is what Cyrus, king of Persia, says: Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has commanded me to build a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you from all his people, may Yahweh your God, be with you. Let him go up to the land."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in the first year** - This refers to the beginning of the reign of King Cyrus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **so that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be carried out** - Here the word "word" can be translated with the verb "spoke." The word "mouth" represents Jeremiah. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that what Yahweh spoke through Jeremiah might happen" or "so that the word from Yahweh that Jeremiah spoke might happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh motivated the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia** - Motivating the spirit is a synecdoche for making someone want to act. AT: "Yahweh made Cyrus, king of Persia, want to act" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **all the kingdoms of the earth** - This is an exaggeration, as there were kingdoms over which Cyrus did not rule. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **to build a house for him** - Here the word "house" represents a temple. AT: "to build a temple for him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his people** - "Yahweh's people"
  * **Let him go up to the land** - "Let that person go up to the land of Judah"
