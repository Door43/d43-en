You must warn them whether \add someone has accused them of\add* murdering someone \f + \ft metonymy \f*, or of disobeying some other law or command or decree \add of Yahweh\add*.

<usfm>
\v 10 In every dispute that your fellow Israelites who live in the cities want you to settle, you must warn them to not sin against Yahweh by telling lies during the trial—regardless of whether the trial is about murder, or about various laws, or about various royal decress. If you do not warn them, God will punish you. Do this so that he does not become angry with you or your fellow Israelites.

<usfm>
\v 10 Whenever any dispute comes to you from your brothers living in their cities, whether over bloodshed, whether over laws and commands, statutes or decrees, you must warn them so that they do not sin against Yahweh, and so that anger does not come down on you and your brothers. If you act in this way, you will not be guilty of sin.
