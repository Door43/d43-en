\v 10 The young men who had grown up with him replied, "\add Those men\add* have said that your father forced them to work very hard for him \f + \ft metaphor \f*, so they want you to reduce the \add work and taxes\add* that your father required from them. But this is what you should tell them: 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.
\v 11 What I mean is that my father required you to \add work hard and pay high taxes\add*. But I will make those loads heavier. \add It was as though\add* my father whipped you, but I will whip you with whips that have pieces of metal in them.'~"

\v 11 My father required you people to work hard and pay high taxes, but I will make the loads you carry even heavier. My father whipped you with leather whips, but I will whip you with scorpions."

\v 10 The young men who had grown up with Rehoboam spoke to him, saying, "This is how you should speak to the people who told you that your father Solomon made their yoke heavy, but that you must make it lighter. This is what you should say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.
\v 11 So now, although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions.'"
