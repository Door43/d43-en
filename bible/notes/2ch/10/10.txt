\v 10 The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Those men have said that your father forced them to work very hard for him , so they want you to reduce the work and taxes that your father required from them. But this is what you should tell them: 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.'
\v 11 What we mean is that your father required the people to work hard and pay high taxes. But tell them that you will make those loads heavier. It was as though your father whipped them with leather whips, but you will whip you with scorpions."

\v 10 The young men who had grown up with Rehoboam spoke with him, saying, "Speak to the people who told you that your father Solomon made their yoke heavy but that you must make it lighter. You should say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.
\v 11 So now, although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions.'"
