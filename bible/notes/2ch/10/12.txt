\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had instructed when he said, "Come back to me on the third day."
\v 13 The king answered them roughly; King Rehoboam ignored the advice of the old men.
\v 14 He spoke to them following the advice of the young men; he said, 
\q "I will make your yoke heavier; I will add to it. 
\q My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions."
