\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king said, "Come back to me on the third day."
\v 13 Rehoboam spoke to them harshly, ignoring the advice of the old men.
\v 14 He spoke to them following the advice of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **on the third day** - "after three days" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it** - A heavy yoke is a metaphor for very difficult labor and cruel treatment. AT: "treated you cruelly, but I will be more cruel" or "forced you to work very hard, but I will make you work harder" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **I will punish you with scorpions** - Possible meanings are that 1) "scorpions" is a metaphor for any kind of painful punishment. AT: "I will punish you much more harshly" or 2) "scorpions" is a metaphor for whips with sharp metal barbs at the end. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:10:10|10:11]]. AT: "I will punish you with whips that have sharp pieces of metal at the ends" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
