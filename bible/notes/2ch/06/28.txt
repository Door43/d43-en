\v 28 And when the people of this land experience famines, or if there is a plague or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemies surround any of their cities in order to attack them—if any of these disaster happens to them—
\v 29 and then if your Israelite people earnestly plead , or if even just one person does so—if they stretch out their hands toward this temple and pray to you because they know the weakness and sorrow in their own hearts—
\v 30 then listen from your home in heaven and forgive them. You alone know what each person is thinking, so reward each person according to everything that he does.
\v 31 Do this in order that they might honor you and conduct their lives as you want them to, all the time that they live in this land that you gave to our ancestors.

\p
\v 28 Suppose there is famine in the land, or suppose that there is disease, blight or mildew, locusts or caterpillars; or suppose that its enemies  attack the city gates in their land, or that there is any plague or sickness—
\v 29 and suppose then that prayers and requests are made by a person or by all your people Israel—each knowing the plague and sorrow in his own heart as he spreads out his hands toward this temple.
\v 30 Then listen from heaven, the place where you live; forgive, and reward every person for all his ways; you know his heart, because you and you only know the hearts of human beings. 
\v 31 Do this so that they may fear you, so that they may walk in your ways all the days that they live on the land that you gave to our ancestors.
