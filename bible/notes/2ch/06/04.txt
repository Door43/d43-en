\v 4 He said, “May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised, who spoke to David, my father, and has fulfilled it with his own hands, saying,
\v 5 ‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, in order for my name to be there. Neither did I choose any man to be prince over my people Israel.
\v 6 However, I have chosen Jerusalem, so that my name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’
