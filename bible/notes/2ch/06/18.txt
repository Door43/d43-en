\v 18 But, my God, will you really live on earth among people \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? There is surely not enough \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* space for you in the sky, or even in the heaven! So there is surely not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* enough space for you to live in this temple that my workers have built.
\v 19 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to my prayer, while I am pleading with this day and do what I am requesting.
\v 20 Please be protecting \f + \ft metonymy \f* this temple day and night. This is the place about which you have said, 'I \f + \ft metonymy \f* will always be there \f + \ft metonymy \f*.' Please listen to my prayer about this place.

\v 18 But, my God, will you really live on earth among us? This temple I have built cannot contain you; not even the universe and heaven itself can contain you.
\v 19 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to my prayer, while I am pleading with this day and do what I am requesting.
\v 20 Always protect this temple, this place where you said you would be present, in order that you might always hear me when I pray, for I am your servant.

\v 18 But will God actually live with mankind on the earth? Look, the entire universe and heaven itself cannot contain you—how much less can this temple that I have built!
\v 19 Yet please respect this prayer of your servant and his request, Yahweh my God; listen to the cry and prayer that your servant prays before you.
\v 20 May your eyes may be open on this temple day and night, to the place about which you have said that you would put your name there—in order to listen to the prayers that your servant will pray toward this place.
