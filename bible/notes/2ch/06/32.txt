\v 32 There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israelite people who have come here from countries far away because they have heard that you are very great and powerful. If they turn toward this temple and pray,
\v 33 then from your home in heaven please listen to their prayer and do for them what they request you to do. Do that in order that all the people groups in the world will honor and obey you, as your people of Israel do. And do this so that they will know that you are present in this temple that I have built.

\v 32 In addition, concerning the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel: when he comes from a far country because of your great name, your mighty hand, and your raised arm; when they come and pray toward this house—
\v 33 then please listen from the heavens, the place where you live, and do whatever the foreigner ask of you, so that all the people groups on earth might know your name, so that they might fear you, as do your people Israel, and so they might know this house I have built is called by your name.
