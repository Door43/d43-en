\v 32 Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of your people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for your great
name’s sake, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:
\v 33 then hear you from heaven, even from your dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for;
that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and fear thee, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this
house which I have built is called by your name.
