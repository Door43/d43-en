\v 7 Now it was in the heart of David my father, to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 8 But Yahweh said to David my father, 'In that it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well for it to be in your heart.
\v 9 Nevertheless, you must not build the house; instead, your son, one who will come from your loins, will build the house for my name.'
