=== What are 1 and 2 Chronicles about? ===

The purpose of 1 and 2 Chronicles was to retell the genealogy of Adam through Jacob’s descendants until the time of the first king of Israel, and to tell the history of the kings of Israel  and Judah until the Babylonian army attacked Judah and took some of the people to Babylon. These books were probably written for the Jews who returned from exile in Babylon. The purpose was to give the people instructions on how to avoid repeating the sins of their ancestors who were unfaithful to the covenant with Yahweh.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

You may also call this book "The Events of the Kings of Judah and Israel, Book 2" or  "The Second Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah and Israel."

=== Who wrote 1 and 2 Chronicles? ===

These books seem to contain many different historical accounts that were put together. The writers of Chronicles mention other books that they took information from in their own writing. The non-biblical sources included "The Chronicles of Samuel the Seer," "The Chronicles of Nathan the Seer," "The Chronicles of Gad the Seer," "The History of Nathan the Prophet," "The Chronicles of Shemaiah the Prophet and Iddo," "The Story of the Prophet Iddo" and "The books of the kings of Judah and Israel."

=== Why are there multiple books which give the history of the kings of Israel? ===

Though the Books of 1 and 2 Chronicles cover much of the same history as the Books of 1 and 2 Kings, they do not repeat everything. The purpose of 1 and 2 Chronicles was not simply to retell the history of Israel and Judah by repeating the books of 1 and 2 Kings. Instead, the writers of these books want to reassure the people that Yahweh would still be faithful to his covenant with them.

The Books of 1 and 2 Chronicles focus on David and Solomon and the reformation that Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah accomplished. Those reformations were to encourage all the people of Yahweh and their leaders to obey the Law and to honor his covenant with them. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])
===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the role of divine retribution in 1 and 2 Chronicles? ===

Retribution is righteous punishment of those who deserve it. This is an important theme in 1 and 2 Chronicles. There is a record of the fulfillment of the promise to bless those who bless Israel and to curse those who curse Israel. The author attempts to show the reader God's blessing or judgment being given to each generation in accordance with their obedience or disobedience of Yahweh's commands. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]])

=== Why are alliances with foreign countries seen as evil in these books? ===

Yahweh was the true leader of Israel and the protector of the nation. He was the one who should have been trusted, instead of the neighboring nations.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of the term "Israel"? ===

The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. The descendants of Jacob, who was also named Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel. This people group developed into the unified nation of Israel. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, while the southern kingdom became known as the kingdom of Judah.

=== What does it mean to "seek God?" ===

The concept of seeking God is very common in 1 and 2 Chronicles. It does not imply that God is hidden; instead, it is a command to seek to please and honor God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

=== What does the phrase "to this day" mean? ===

This phrase was used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that "to this day" refers to a time which has already passed. The translator might decide to say, "to this day, at the time when this is being written," or, "to this day, at the time of writing." This Hebrew phrase occurs in 2 Chronicles 5:9; 8:8; 10:19; 20:26; 21:10; 35:25.
