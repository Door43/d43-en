\v 23 It came about at the end of the year, that the army of the Aram came up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem; they killed all the leaders of the people and sent all the plunder from them to the king of Damascus.
\v 24 The army of the Arameans had come with a small army, but Yahweh gave them victory over a  very great army, because Judah had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their ancestors. In this way the Arameans brought judgment on Joash.
