\p
\v 25 By the time that the Arameans had gone, Joash had been severely wounded. His own servants plotted against him because of the murder of the sons of Jehoiada, the priest. They killed him in his bed, and he died; they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
\v 26 These were the persons who plotted against him: Zabad, the son of Shimeath, the Ammonitess; and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, the Moabitess.
