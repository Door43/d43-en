\v 20 The Spirit of God came on Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, the priest; Zechariah stood above the people and said to them, “God says this: ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of Yahweh, so that you cannot prosper? Since you have forsaken Yahweh, he has also forsaken you.’”
\v 21 But they plotted against him; at the king’s command, they stoned him with stones in the courtyard of the house of Yahweh.
\v 22 In this manner, Joash, the king, ignored the kindness that Jehoiada, Zechariah’s father, had done to him. Instead, he killed Jehoiada’s son. When Zechariah was dying, he said, “May Yahweh see this and call you to account.”
