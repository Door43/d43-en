\v 6 So the king called for Jehoiada the high priest and said to him, "Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses the servant of Yahweh and by the assembly of Israel for the tent of the covenant decrees?"
\v 7 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God and had given all the holy things of the house of Yahweh to the Baals.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Why have you not required the Levites ... covenant decrees?** - King Joash asks this rhetorical question to accuse Jehoiada of not doing his duty. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You have neglected your duty. I told you to require the Levites ... covenant decrees, but you have not done it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **for the tent of the covenant decrees** - Although it refers to the temple that Solomon built, it is a reminder that this tax has been collected since the time of Moses and the "tent of meeting."
  * **holy things** - This refers to the items used for worship in the temple.
  * **to the Baals** - "to people to use for the worship of idols of Baal"
