\v 4 It came about after this, that Joash decided to restore the house of Yahweh.
\v 5 He gathered together the priests and the Levites, and he said to them, "Go out every year to the cities of Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God. Make sure that you start right away." The Levites did nothing at first.
