\v 13 The men who did the repair work worked hard, and the work of repairing the temple progressed. They rebuilt the temple to cause it to be like it was originally, and they made it stronger.
\v 14 When they had finished the repair work, they brought to the king and to Jehoiada the money that they had not used for the repairs. That money was used to make things to use for offering the sacrifices that were completely burned \add on the altar\add*, and to make bowls and other gold and silver things for the temple. As long as Joash lived, the people continually brought to the temple sacrifices that were to be completely burned on the altar.

\v 13 So the workmen wrought, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its
state, and strengthened it.
\v 14 And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels
for the house of Jehovah, even vessels wherewith to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they
offered burnt offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.
