== Joash repairs the temple ==

Joash decided to repair the temple. The Levites collected money from people and gave it to the workmen to repair the temple. This was a sign of worship towards Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:temple]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sign]])

== Joash becomes evil ==

When Joash stopped worshiping Yahweh, he had many troubles. Joash remaind loyal to Yahweh as long as the chief priest lived, but when the chief priest died Joash started following other gods. The chief priest's son warned him that he would have trouble, so he had him killed. The army of Aram defeated and plundered him and his servants murdered him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]] and [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])
