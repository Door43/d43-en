\v 11 It happened that whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officials by the hand of the Levites, and whenever they saw that there was much money in it, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s official would come, empty the chest, and take it and carry it back to its place. They did this day after day, gathering large amounts of money.
\v 12 The king and Jehoiada gave the money to those who did the work of serving in the house of Yahweh. These men hired stonemasons and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh, and also those who worked in iron and bronze.
