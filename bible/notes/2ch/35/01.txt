===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh** - Josiah commanded the people to celebrate the Passover that Yahweh had commanded their ancestors to celebrate.
  * **in Jerusalem** - Yahweh had commanded Moses that all the people of Israel were to go to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover.
  * **the fourteenth day of the first month** - This is the first month of the Hebrew calendar. The fourteenth day is near the beginning of April on Western calendars. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **He placed the priests in their positions** - Commanding the priests to stand in a certain place is a metaphoric metonym for telling them which jobs to do. The reader should probably understand that Josiah commanded his officials to give instructions to the priests. AT: "He had people tell the priests which jobs to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the service of** - The abstract noun "service" can be translated as a verb. Possible meanings are 1) AT: "as they served in" or 2) AT: "to serve well in." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
