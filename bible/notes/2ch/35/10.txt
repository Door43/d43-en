\v 10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the
king’s commandment.
\v 11 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they
received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.
\v 12 And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the
children of the people, to offer to Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.
