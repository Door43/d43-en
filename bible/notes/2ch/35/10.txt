\v 10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, with the Levites by their divisions, in response to the king's command.
\v 11 They killed the Passover lambs, and the priests sprinkled the blood that they received from the Levites' hand, and the Levites skinned the lambs.
\v 12 They removed the burnt offerings, in order to distribute them to the divisions of the ancestral houses of the people, to offer them to Yahweh, as it is written in The Book of Moses. They did the same with the bulls.
