===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **your divisions** - This refers to the assigned work group for each Levite.
  * **the ancestral houses** - This refers to the various clans among the Levites. It seems that Levites were assigned to different work groups on the basis of the kind of work assigned to each clan or ancestral house. 
  * **Stand in the holy place **- Here "holy place" seems to refer to the general temple area. AT: "take your positions in the temple area."
