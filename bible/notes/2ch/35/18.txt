\v 18 Such a Passover celebration had never been held in Israel from the days of the prophet Samuel; nor had any of the other kings of Israel ever celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did, along with the priests, Levites, and all the people of Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 19 This Passover was kept in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah.
