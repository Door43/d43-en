\v 13 They roasted the Passover lambs with fire following the instructions. As for the consecrated offerings, they boiled them in pots, caldrons, and pans, and they quickly carried them to all the people.
\v 14 They later prepared offerings for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were occupied in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until nightfall, so the Levites prepared the offerings for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
