\v 19 But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have placed before you, and if you go worship other gods and bow down to them, 
\v 20 then I will uproot them from out of my ground that I have given them. And this house that I have set apart for my name, I will cast it away from before me, and I will make it a proverb and a joke among all the peoples.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will uproot them from out of my ground that I have given them** - AT: "I will remove them from my land." Compares pulling plants up by their roots from the soil, with the removal of God's people of Israel from his land. The results would be destruction of the nation and sadness of the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
