\v 19 But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have placed before you, and if you go worship other gods and bow down to them, 
\v 20 then I will uproot them from out of my ground that I have given them; and this house that I have consecrated for my name—I will cast it away from before me, and I will make it a proverb and a joke among all the peoples.
