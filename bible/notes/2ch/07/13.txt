====== 2 Chronicles 07:13-15 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 When I prevent any rain from falling, or when I command locusts to eat all the crops \f + \ft metonymy \f*, or when I send a plague among my people,
\v 14 if the people who belong to me \f + \ft metonymy \f* humble themselves and pray, and request me to help them \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and if they turn away from their sinful behavior, then I will hear from heaven. I will forgive them for having sinned and I will cause them to prosper again.
\v 15 I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will see them and I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will hear them when they pray to me in this place.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 When I prevent any rain from falling, or when I command locusts to eat all the crops, or when I send a plague among my people,
\v 14 then if the people who belong to me, are sorry for their sins and stop doing them, and if they plead with me for me to forgive, then I will indeed listen from heaven. I will forgive them for having sinned, and I will cause them to prosper again.
\v 15 I will listen to them when they pray to me in this place.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Suppose that I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send disease among my people,
\v 14 then if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
\v 15 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers that are made in this place.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Suppose that I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain** - Here "heavens" refers to the sky, and is spoken of as if it were a building in which God stores the rain. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:06:26|6:26]].  AT: "Suppose that I do not allow the rain to fall from the skies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **devour the land** - The word "land" represents the plants and crops on the land.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **if I send disease among my people** - Here "send disease" represents causing diseases. AT: "if I cause my people to have diseases" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **seek my face** - AT: "search for God" or "try to get God to pay attention to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my eyes will be open ... my ears attentive** - The words "eyes" and "ears" refer to God, who chooses to see and hear their prayers. AT: "I will see them and I will listen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
