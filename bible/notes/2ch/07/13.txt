\v 13 If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence
among my people;
\v 14 if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked
ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
