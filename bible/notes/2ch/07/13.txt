<usfm>
\v 13 When I prevent any rain from falling, or when I command locusts to eat all the crops \f + \ft metonymy \f*, or when I send a plague among my people,
\v 14 if the people who belong to me \f + \ft metonymy \f* humble themselves and pray, and request me to help them \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and if they turn away from their sinful behavior, then I will hear from heaven. I will forgive them for having sinned and I will cause them to prosper again.
\v 15 I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will see them and I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will hear them when they pray to me in this place.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 When I prevent any rain from falling, or when I command locusts to eat all the crops, or when I send a plague among my people,
\v 14 then if the people who belong to me, are sorry for their sins and stop doing them, and if they plead with me for me to forgive, then I will indeed listen from heaven. I will forgive them for having sinned, and I will cause them to prosper again.
\v 15 I will listen to them when they pray to me in this place.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Suppose that I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send disease among my people.
\v 14 then if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
\v 15 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers that are made in this place.
