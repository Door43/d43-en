\v 4 'Yahweh says that you must not go to fight against \add the people of Israel; it is as though they are\add* your own relatives. All of you must go home.

\v 2 But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, the man of God; it said,
\v 3 "Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin; say,
\v 4 ‘Yahweh says this: You must not attack or fight against your brothers. Each man must return to his house, for this thing has been made to happen by me.’” So they listened to the words of Yahweh and turned back from going against Jeroboam.
