\v 2 But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\v 3 "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
\v 4 'Yahweh says this, "You must not attack or make war against your brothers. Everyone must return to his own house, for I have caused this to happen.'" So they obeyed the words of Yahweh and turned back from attacking Jeroboam.
