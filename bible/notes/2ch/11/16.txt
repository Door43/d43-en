<usfm>
\v 16 People from all the tribes of Israel came after them, those who set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel; they came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
\v 17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, strong, during three years—for they walked in the path of David and Solomon for three years.
