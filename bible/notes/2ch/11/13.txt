\v 13 The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel went over to him from within their borders.
\v 14 For the Levites left their pasturelands and property in order to come to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had driven them away, so that they could no longer perform priestly duties for Yahweh.
\v 15 Jeroboam appointed for himself priests for the high places and the goat and calf idols he had made.
