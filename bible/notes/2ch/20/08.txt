===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Our ancestors lived here and built a temple at which to worship you. At that time they prayed:
\v 9 'If we experience disasters, either from our enemies attacking us, or from disease or hunger, we will assemble at this temple in your presence, for you agreed to be present here. We will plead with you because of the things we are suffering, and you will hear us and will rescue us.'


\pi

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 They lived in it and built you a holy place in it for your name, saying,
\v 9 'If disaster comes on us—the sword, judgment, or disease, or famine—we will stand before this house, and before you (for your name is in this house), and we will cry to you in our affliction, and you will hear us and save us.'
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa judgment \fqa* , some ancient and modern versions read \fqa flood \fqa* . \f*
