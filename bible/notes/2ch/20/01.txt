\v 1 It came about after this, that the people of Moab and Ammon, and with them some Meunites came against Jehoshaphat to do battle.
\f + \ft The reading \fqa some Meunites \fqa* represents a correction to the Hebrew text, which reads, \fqa some Ammonites \fqa* . It is thought that \fqa Meunites \fqa* was original, and that a copyist changed it to \fqa some Ammonites \fqa* . But this last reading makes no sense, because Ammonites have already been mentioned in this verse. However, different versions deal with this problem in different ways. \f*
\v 2 Then some came who told Jehoshaphat, saying, "A large multitude is coming against you from beyond the Dead Sea, from Edom. See, they are in Hazezon Tamar," that is, Engedi.
 \f + \ft Instead of \fqa Edom \fqa* , some ancient and modern versions read, \fqa Aram \fqa* . \f*
