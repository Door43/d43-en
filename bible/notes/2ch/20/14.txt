  * **Jahaziel ... Zechariah ... Benaiah ... Jeiel ... Mattaniah ... Asaph** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **all Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem** - Here "Judah" refers to the people who live there. AT: "all you who live in Judah and Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
