\v 10 You would not allow our Israelite ancestors to enter the countries of Ammon and Moab and Edom when they were traveling from Egypt \add to Canaan\add*. So our ancestors turned away from those areas and did not attack the people there and did not destroy them. But now they are coming here \add to attack us\add*.
\v 11 \add We did good things for them\add*. But now look at how they are repaying us by trying to expel us from the land that you gave to our ancestors to belong to them \add and their descendants forever\add*!

\v 10 See now, here are the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir whom you would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt; instead, Israel turned away from them and did not destroy them.
\v 11 See how they are rewarding us; they are coming to drive us out of your land that you have given us to inherit.
