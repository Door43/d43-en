\v 11 \add We did good things for them\add*. But now look at how they are repaying us by trying to expel us from the land that you gave to our ancestors to belong to them \add and their descendants forever\add*!

\v 10 See now, here are the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt; instead, Israel turned away from them and did not destroy them.
\v 11 See how they are rewarding us; they are coming to drive us out of your land that you have given us to inherit.
