\v 25 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take plunder from them, they found on them abundance riches and
precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. It took them three days to carry off the plunder, there was so much of it.
\v 26 On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah. There they praised Yahweh, so the
name of that place is The Valley of Beracah to this day.
