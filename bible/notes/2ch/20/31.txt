\v 32 He did things that were pleasing to  Yahweh, like his father Asa had done, and he did not stop doing those things.
\v 33 But he did not get rid of the shrines in the countryside, and many of the people still were not serious about obeying the God whom their ancestors had worshiped.

\v 31 Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His motherâ€™s name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
\v 32 He walked in the ways of Asa, his father; he did not turn away from them; he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 33 However, the shrines were still not taken away, nor had the people yet directed their hearts to the God of their ancestors.
