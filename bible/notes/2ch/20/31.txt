\v 31 Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
\v 32 He walked in the ways of Asa, his father; he did not turn away from them; he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 33 However, the shrines were still not taken away, nor had the people yet directed their hearts to the God of their ancestors.
