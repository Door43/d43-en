=== Outline of the Book of Philemon ===

  - Paul greets Philemon (1:1–3)
  - Then Paul asks on behalf of Onesimus that Philemon would accept him as a Christian brother (1:4–21)
  - Paul finishes by announcing his intention to visit and sends greetings (1:22–25)

=== What is the Book of Philemon about? ===

Paul wrote this letter to a man named Philemon.  Philemon was a member of the church and also a slave owner.  Paul wrote to him to ask that he would not punish his slave Onesimus who had run away from Philemon.  By Roman law Philemon had the right to put Onesimus to death.  Paul uses persuasive arguments to encourage Philemon to accept Onesimus as a Christian brother and even suggests that Onesimus be allowed to serve alongside Paul (1:13-14).

=== Who wrote the Book of Philemon? ===

The short book of Philemon was written by the Apostle Paul (1:1).  Paul was in prison while he wrote it, which means that he was probably writing it from Rome.  If he was in Rome then it would have been written about 61 years after the birth of Christ, which is the same time that he would have written Colossians.
