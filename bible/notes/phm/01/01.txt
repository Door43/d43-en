===== Translation Notes: =====

This book is a letter that Paul wrote to a man named Philemon.

  * **Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon**  - Your language may have a particular way of introducing the authors of a letter. This could be translated as “We, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother, write this letter to Philemon.”
  * **a prisoner of Christ Jesus**  - "who is in prison for teaching about Jesus Christ." People who did not like Jesus punished Paul by putting him in prison.
  * **our beloved brother** - "our dear fellow believer" or "our spiritual brother whom we love"
  * **and fellow-worker**  - "who, like us, works to spread the gospel"
  * **Apphia, our sister** - This means "Apphia, our fellow believer" or "Apphia, our spiritual sister" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Archippus**  - This is the name of man.
  * **our fellow-soldier**  - Here "soldier" is a metaphor that describes a person who struggles to spread the Gospel. This may be translated as "our fellow-spiritual warrior" or "who also fights the spiritual battle with us." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the church in your house**  - "the group of believers that meets in your house" (UDB)
  * **your house** - The word "your" is singular and refers to Philemon. 
  * **Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ** - "May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace." This is a blessing. The word "you" is plural and refers to all the people Paul greeted in verses 1 and 2.
