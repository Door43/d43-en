\v 14 Nevertheless, because \add I had not yet asked you and\add* you had not yet permitted me \add to keep him here with me\add*, I decided not to \add keep him here. I decided that I should\add* not do anything without your permitting it. \add I decided that you should help me only if you\add* really want to help me.
\v 15 Perhaps the reason that \add God permitted\add* Onesimus to be separated from \f + \ft Or:to leave \f* you for a little while was that \add he would believe in Christ, and as a result\add* you would have him back\f + \ft Or: with you \f* forever!
\v 16 \add You will no longer have him only\add* as a slave. Instead, \add you will have him\add* as \add someone who is\add* more than a slave. \add You will have him\add* as a fellow believer! He is especially dear to me, but he certainly will be more dear to you \add than he is to me\add* \f + \ft Or: I love him very much, but you will certainly love him more than I do \f*, \add because now he\add* not only belongs to you but he also belongs to the Lord.

\v 14 However, because I had not yet asked you and you had not yet permitted me to keep him here with me, I decided not to keep him here. I decided that you should help me only if you really want to help me.
\v 15 Perhaps the reason that God permitted Onesimus to be separated from you was so you could have him back forever!
\v 16 You will no longer have him only as a slave. Instead, you will have him as someone who is more than a slave. You will have him as a fellow believer! He is very dear to me, but he certainly will be even more dear to you. This is because now he not only belongs to you as a slave, but he also belongs to the Lord.

\v 14 But without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness should not be as forced, but as free will.
\v 15 For perhaps he was separated from you for a while, in order that you should have him forever,
\v 16 no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a brother beloved, especially to me, and yet how much even more so to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
