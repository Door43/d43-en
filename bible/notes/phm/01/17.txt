\v 17 So, if you consider me to be your partner \add in God's work\add*, receive him as you would receive me.
\v 18 If he has wronged you in any manner or if he owes you anything, charge that to me\f + \ft Or: tell me so that I can pay you \f*.
\v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you, although I might mention to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus may owe you, because it was the result of my telling you about Christ that God saved your soul\f + \ft Or: you \f*.


\p
\v 20 Yes\f + \ft Or: I say it again \f*, my dear friend, because you and I both have a relationship with the Lord, I want you to do this for me. Encourage me \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add by receiving Onesimus kindly, just like you encourage others who believe\add* in Christ.

\v 17 So if you believe that you and I are doing God's work together, welcome him as you would welcome me.
\v 18 If he has done you any kind of harm, or if he is in debt to you, let me take the responsibility for that.
\v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you. I could say to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus owes you, because what I told you saved your own life.


\p
\v 20 Indeed, my brother, cause me to rejoice with the Lord. Since we are both joined to Christ, make my heart glad.

\v 17 If then you regard me a partner, receive him as myself.
\v 18 But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my own account.
\v 19 I, Paul, write with mine own hand:  I will repay it. I do not mention to you that you owe me your very life.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If then you regard me a partner** -  "If you think of me as a fellow worker for Christ"
  * **charge that to my own account** - This can be translated as "charge it to me" or "say that I am the one who owes you." 
  * **I, Paul, write with mine own hand** - This could be translated as "I, Paul, write this myself." Paul wrote this so that Philemon would know that the words were true; Paul really would pay him. 
  * **I will repay it** - "I will pay you what he owes you"
  * **I do not mention to you** - This can be translated as "I do not need to remind you" or "You know." 
  * **you owe me your very life** - "you owe me your own life."  The reason Philemon owed Paul his life can be made explicit: "you owe me much because I saved your life" or "you owe me your own life because what I told you saved your life."  Paul was implying that Philemon should not say that Onesimus or Paul owed him anything because Onesimus owed Paul even more. (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **refresh my heart** - This can be translated as "make my heart glad" or "make me glad" or "comfort me." How Paul wanted Onesimus to do this can be made explicit: "refresh my heart by accepting Onesimus kindly."
