====== Philemon 01:17-20 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 So, if you consider me to be your partner \add in God's work\add*, receive him as you would receive me.
\v 18 If he has wronged you in any manner or if he owes you anything, charge that to me\f + \ft Or: tell me so that I can pay you \f*.
\v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you, although I might mention to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus may owe you, because it was the result of my telling you about Christ that God saved your soul\f + \ft Or: you \f*.


\p
\v 20 Yes\f + \ft Or: I say it again \f*, my dear friend, because you and I both have a relationship with the Lord, I want you to do this for me. Encourage me \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add by receiving Onesimus kindly, just like you encourage others who believe\add* in Christ.

\v 17 So if you believe that you and I are doing God's work together, welcome him as you would welcome me.
\v 18 If he has done you any kind of harm, or if he is in debt to you, let me take the responsibility for that.
\v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you. I could say to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus owes you, because what I told you saved your own life.
\p
\v 20 Indeed, my brother, cause me to rejoice with the Lord. Since we are both joined to Christ, make my heart glad.

<usfm>
\v 17 And so if you regard me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
\v 18 But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
\v 19 I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will pay you back. I do not mention to you that you owe me your very life.
\v 20 Yes, brother, let me have some joy in the Lord from you; refresh my heart in Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **if you regard me a partner** - "if you think of me as a fellow worker for Christ"

  * **I, Paul, write this with my own hand** -  "I, Paul, write this myself." Paul wrote this part with his own hand so that Philemon would know that the words were really from Paul. Paul really would pay him.

  * **you owe me your very life** - "you owe me your own life." Paul was implying that Philemon should not say that Onesimus or Paul owed him anything because Philemon owed Paul even more. The reason Philemon owed Paul his life can be made explicit. AT: "you owe me much because I saved your life" or "you owe me your own life because what I told you saved your life"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
