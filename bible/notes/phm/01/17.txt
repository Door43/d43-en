\v 17 So, if you consider me to be your partner \add in God's work\add*, receive him as you would receive me.
\v 18 If he has wronged you in any manner or if he owes you anything, charge that to me\f + \ft Or: tell me so that I can pay you \f*.
\v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you, although I might mention to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus may owe you, because it was the result of my telling you about Christ that God saved your soul\f + \ft Or: you \f*.


\p
\v 20 Yes\f + \ft Or: I say it again \f*, my dear friend, because you and I both have a relationship with the Lord, I want you to do this for me. Encourage me \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add by receiving Onesimus kindly, just like you encourage others who believe\add* in Christ.

<usfm>
\v 17 So if you believe that you and I are doing God's work together, welcome him as you would welcome me.
\v 18 If he has done you any kind of harm, or if he is in debt to you, Ilet me take the responsibility for that.
\v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you. I could say to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus owes you, because what I told you saved your own life.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If then you regard me a partner** -  "If you think of me as a fellow worker for Christ"
  * **charge that to my own account** - This can be translated as "charge it to me" or "say that I am the one who owes you." 
 * **I, Paul, write with mine own hand** - This could be translated as "I, Paul, write this myself." The word "this" could refer to this part of the letter, or to the next sentence. Paul wrote that so that Philemon would know that the words were true; Paul really would pay him. 
  * **I will repay it** - "I will pay you what he owes you"
  * **I do not mention to you** - Paul is using irony here to emphasize that he actually is mentioning this to Philemon. This could be translated as "I must also remind you" or "Remember" or "Do not forget". (See: [[en:ta:translate:irony]])
  * **you owe me your very life** - The reason Philemon owed Paul his life can be made explicit as it is in the UDB: "you owe me your own life because what I told you saved your life." (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **refresh my heart** - Here "heart" is a metonym and refers to emotions or thoughts. It could be translated as "give me courage" (UDB) or "give me comfort." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
