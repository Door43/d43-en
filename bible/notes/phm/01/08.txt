\v 8 So I want to ask you to do something. I am completely confident that I have the authority to command you to do what you should do, because I am an apostle of Christ.
\v 9 But because I know that you love God's people, I request this instead of commanding you to do it. It is I, Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner because I serve Christ Jesus, who am requesting it.
