\v 10 I request that you do something for Onesimus. He is now like a son of mine because I told him about Christ here in prison.
\v 11 Although his name, as you know, means "useful," he was useless to you in the past. But now he is useful both to you and to me!


\p
\v 12 Although he is very dear to me, I am sending him back to you.
\v 13 I would like to have kept him with me, in order that he might serve me in your place.  I need him because I am in prison because of my preaching the message about Christ.

\v 10 I ask you concerning my child Onesimus,  whom I have fathered in my bonds.
\v 11 For he once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable both to you and to me.
\v 12 I have sent him—who is my very heart—back to you.
\v 13 I wish I could have kept him with me, so he could serve me in your place, while I am in chains for the sake of gospel.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Onesimus**  - This is the name of a man. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **my child Onesimus** -  "my son Onesimus." Paul compared his close relationship with Onesimus to the relationship that a father and his son have. Onesimus was not Paul's actual son, but he received spiritual life when Paul taught him about Jesus, and Paul loved him. This can be translated as "my dear son Onesimus" or "my spiritual son Onesimus." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whom I have fathered**  - This can be translated as "who became a son to me" or "who became like a son to me." How Onesimus became like a son to Paul can be made explicit: "who became my spiritual son when I taught him about Christ and he received new life." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in my bonds**  - "in my chains." This can be translated as "while being in prison." Prisoners were often bound in chains. Paul was in prison when he taught Onesimus, and he was still in prison when he wrote this letter. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he once was unprofitable**  - This could be translated as a new sentence: "Before, he was useless."
  * **but now is profitable**  - "but now he is is useful." Translators may also add a footnote that says "The name Onesimus means 'profitable' or 'useful'."
  * **I have sent him—who is my very heart—back to you**  - Paul was probably writing the letter just before sending Onesimus.
  * **who is my very heart**  - Here the word "heart" is used for someone who is dearly loved. This phrase could be translated as "whom I love dearly." Paul was saying this about Onesimus. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **so he could serve me in your place**  - "that, since you cannot be here, he might help me." It could also be translated as a separate sentence: He would be helping me in your place."
  * **I am in chains**  - This can also be translated as "while I am in prison" or "because I am in prison."
  * **for the sake of the gospel**  - This can be translated here as "because I preach the gospel."
