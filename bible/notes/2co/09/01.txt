<usfm> \v 1 Now about this collection of money for the believers in Jerusalem—all those people whom God has set apart for himself, I really do not need to write anything more to you. \v 2 I already know that you want to help, and I praised you for this to the believers of Macedonia. In fact, I told them that you and the other people of the province of Achaia, have been preparing for this collection since last year. Your enthusiasm is an example that has moved the believers of Macedonia to take action. </usfm>
