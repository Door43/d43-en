\v 1 Now I want to write more about the gift of money  that you and other believers are preparing to send to the believers in Judea province. I do not really need to continue writing to you about it,
\v 2 because I already know that you really want to help them. In fact, I have been boasting about you, telling the believers here in Macedonia province that you people in Achaia province have been ready to help, beginning from last year. As a result, because you are very eager to help the believers in Judea province, you have made most of the believers here in Macedonia province also want to give a gift.

\v 1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
\v 2 for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year
past; and your zeal has stirred up very many of them.
