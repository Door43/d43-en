\v 12 We receive this money, not only to help our Christian brothers and sisters in need; we also do it so that many, many believers will thank God.
\v 13 Because you began this task, you have shown what kind of people you are. You honor God by obeying him and believing what he says in the good news about Christ. You also honor him by giving generously.
\v 14 The ones to whom you will give will greatly desire to see you; they will pray for you, because of the wonderful way in which God has been kind to you.
\v 15 We give thanks to God for this gift from him—his gift is so great we cannot express it in words.
