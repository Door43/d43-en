\v 1 The last visit I made to Corinth I know that I hurt you very much by what I said to you. I decided this time that I would not make another painful visit  to you.
\v 2  I caused you much pain on my last visit, and the people who could cheer me up the most would be the same people whom I hurt when I was there.

\v 1 So I decided for my own part that I would not again come to you in painful circumstances.
\v 2 If I caused you pain, who could cheer me up but the very one who was hurt by me?
