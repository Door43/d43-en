\v 1 The last visit I made to Corinth I know that I hurt you very much by what I said to you. I decided this time that I would not make another painful visit  to you.
\v 2  I caused you much pain on my last visit, and the people who could cheer me up the most would be the same people whom I hurt when I was there.

\v 1 So I decided for my own part that I would not again come to you in painful circumstances.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Paul continues the letter to the people of the church at Corinth

    * **So I decided for my own part **  - "I made the decision"
    * **you in painful circumstances**  -  AT: "when you are doing things I strongly disapprove of" 
    * **If I caused you pain, who could cheer me up but the very one who was hurt by me?**  - Paul tells the Corinthians that they make him happy and hurting them would make both of them unhappy. AT: "If I caused you pain, I would be unhappy because you are unhappy." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
