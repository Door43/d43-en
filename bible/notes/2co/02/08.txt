===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 For those reasons, I beg you to  \add forgive him and accept him into your group again, and thus\add* assure him that you truly love him.
\v 9  \add I feel sure that you will do as I ask\add*, because when I wrote  \add severely\add* to you  \add before\add*, I did it to test you by seeing whether or not you really would do everything  \add that I, as your apostle, asked you to do\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 In front of all the believers, tell him how much you love him.
\v 9  I wrote you to see if you would obey God and deal with this problem.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 So I encourage you to publicly affirm your love for him.
\v 9 This was the reason I wrote, so that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul encourages the church in Corinth to forgive the person they have punished.
    * **publicly affirm your love for him** - This is to welcome him back into the fellowship of believers. AT: "announce at the group meeting that you do still love him like you love family"
    * **you are obedient in everything** - This refers to both punishing someone who is guilty and forgiving them afterwards. AT: "you are obedient in everything I have taught you to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
