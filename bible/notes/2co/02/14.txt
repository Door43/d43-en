\v 14 However, \add before I tell you anymore about that\add*, I  \add want to\add* thank God  \add for what he is doing. As a great leader of fighting men causes all his prisoners to take part in his victory parade\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, God leads us  \add who are his workers\add* to always win out  \add over Satan because of our\f + \ft exclusive \f* close relationship with Christ. God causes people to come to\add* know Jesus Christ as a result of our\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* teaching his message. That message is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the smell of perfume.
\v 15  \add When we\f + \ft exclusive \f* tell God's message\add* about Christ, it  \add spreads out among people\add* like the smell of perfume. \add Those who believe the message that we tell them\add* are saved \f + \ft Or:\add Jesus Christ\add* saves them \f* \add from the guilt of their sin. But those who reject that message\add* will be separated from God  \add forever\add*.

\v 14 We thank God that we are joined together with Christ, and Christ always leads us in his march of victory. Through our lives and our message, everywhere we go, we are like those who have been near burning incense; but our fragrance does not come from real incense, but it comes from knowing Christ, and because we know him we have his fragrant aroma.
\v 15 God smells this same fragrance, and it reminds him of Christ. And those who God rescues smell this same fragrance in us. Even the people whom God does not rescue smell that aroma that reminds them of Christ.

\v 14 But may thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph. Through us he spreads the sweet aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere.
\v 15 For we are to God the sweet aroma of Christ, both among those who are saved and among those who are perishing.
