\v 15  \add When we\f + \ft exclusive \f* tell God's message\add* about Christ, it  \add spreads out among people\add* like the smell of perfume. \add Those who believe the message that we tell them\add* are saved \f + \ft Or:\add Jesus Christ\add* saves them \f* \add from the guilt of their sin.

\v 14 We thank God that we are joined together with Christ, and he always leads us in procession just like we have won a war! Through our lives and our message, everywhere we go, we are like the fragrance of incense that people love to smell, and that fragrance comes from knowing Christ.
\v 15  God smells this same fragrance, and it reminds him of Christ. And those who God rescues smell this same fragrance in us. Even the people whom God does not rescue smell that aroma that reminds them of Christ.
