\v 14 However, before I tell you anymore about that, I  want to thank God  for what he is doing. As a great leader of fighting men causes all his prisoners to take part in his victory parade, God leads us who are his workers to always win out over Satan because of our close relationship with Christ. God causes people to come to know Jesus Christ as a result of our teaching his message. That message is like the smell of perfume.
\v 15  When we tell God's message about Christ, itspreads out among people like the smell of perfume. Those who believe the message that we tell them are saved from the guilt of their sin. But those who reject that message will be separated from God  forever.
