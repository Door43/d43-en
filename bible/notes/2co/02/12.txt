\v 12  \add I will continue by telling you what I did after I wrote to you from Ephesus city\add*. I went to Troas  \add city\add* in order to  \add tell people\add* the message  \add about\add* Christ. \add When I arrived there\add*, I found  \add many people\add* who had been prepared by the Lord  \add Jesus\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to listen to what I told them about him\add*.
\v 13 But because my fellow believer Titus had not  \add arrived with a report from you\add*, I still felt very anxious and concerned  \add about you\add*. So, \add after spending only a short time at Troas\add*, I said 'goodbye' to  \add the believers who were there\add* and came  \add here\add* to Macedonia  \add province to find Titus\add*.

\v 12 Even though the Lord opened many ways for us to share the good news in the city of Troas,
\v 13 I was worried about our brother Titus, because I did not find him there. So I left the believers in Troas and returned to Macedonia to look for him.

\v 12 Though a door was opened to me by the Lord when I came to the city of Troas to preach the gospel of Christ there, 
\v 13 I had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I left them and returned to Macedonia.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Though a door was opened to me**  - Just like an open door allows one to walk through, so Paul was given an opportunity to share the gospel message at Troas. AT: "I was given an opportunity" - (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **my brother Titus**  - Paul often refers to other people who share in his ministry his brother in Christ.
    * **So I left them**  - "So I left the people of Troas"
