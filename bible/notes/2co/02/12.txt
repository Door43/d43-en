\v 13 But because my fellow believer Titus had not  \add arrived with a report from you\add*, I still felt very anxious and concerned  \add about you\add*.

\v 12 Even though the Lord opened many ways for us to share the good news in the city of Troas,
\v 13 I was worried about our brother Titus, because I did not find him there. So I left the believers in Troas and returned to Macedonia to look for him.

\v 12 Though a door was opened to me by the Lord when I came to the city of Troas to preach the gospel of Christ there, 
\v 13 I had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I left them and returned to Macedonia.
