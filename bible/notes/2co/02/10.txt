====== 2 Corinthians 02:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 So  \add since you obeyed what I told you before, I feel sure that now you will obey what I am writing in this letter\add* and forgive the man, as I have done, because I indeed have forgiven him for the wrong thing that he did. Anything he needed me to forgive him for, I have forgiven, and Christ knows  \add that I have forgiven him sincerely. I have done that mainly\add* to help you  \add so that you and I will again have fellowship with each other, and that you will accept him into your group again\add*.
\v 11  \add I want you to forgive him\add* so that Satan will not be able to take advantage of  \add the problems among\add* us  \add and make the situation worse\add*. We know very well \f + \ft litotes \f* that he is always planning to  \add cause problems among us\add*.

<usfm>
\v 10 So the man you forgave, I also forgive. Whatever I have forgiven—even the smallest matters—I have forgiven out of my love for you, and I forgive as though Christ were standing in front of me.
\v 11 By forgiving this man, we made it so Satan could not trick us into doing something worse. We know all about his tricks and his lies.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 If you forgive anyone, I forgive that person as well. What I have forgiven—if I have forgiven anything—it is forgiven for your sake in the presence of Christ.
\v 11 This is so that Satan will not trick us. For we are not ignorant of his plans.
