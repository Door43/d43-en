====== 2 Corinthians 02:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 So  \add since you obeyed what I told you before, I feel sure that now you will obey what I am writing in this letter\add* and forgive the man, as I have done, because I indeed have forgiven him for the wrong thing that he did. Anything he needed me to forgive him for, I have forgiven, and Christ knows  \add that I have forgiven him sincerely. I have done that mainly\add* to help you  \add so that you and I will again have fellowship with each other, and that you will accept him into your group again\add*.
\v 11  \add I want you to forgive him\add* so that Satan will not be able to take advantage of  \add the problems among\add* us  \add and make the situation worse\add*. We know very well \f + \ft litotes \f* that he is always planning to  \add cause problems among us\add*.

\v 10 And so, the one you forgive, I also forgive. Whatever I have forgiven—even the smallest matters—I have forgiven out of my love for you and I forgive as though I were standing before Christ when I do it.
\v 11  We deal with this matter in this way so that Satan Satan cannot outwit us and win by his trickery. We know all about his tricks and lies.

<usfm>
\v 10 But anyone you forgive, I forgive as well.  What I have forgiven--if I have forgiven anything--it is forgiven for your sake in the presence of Christ.
\v 11 We do this so Satan will not outwit us. For we are not ignorant of his schemes.
