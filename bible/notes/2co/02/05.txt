====== 2 Corinthians 02:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5  \add Now I want to write about the man who\add* caused all this anguish. \add What he did was very wrong, but\add* I know that it has caused you much more sorrow than it has caused me, because  \add what he did\add* has  \add affected\add* all of you  \add to some extent. I say\add*, "to some extent," \add because I do not want to say that he has\add* done more harm  \add than he really has done\add*.
\v 6  \add Since he has now stopped sinning in that way\add*, the punishment that nearly all of you  \add decided was right for him\add* has continued long enough.
\v 7 So now, instead  \add of punishing him any longer\add*, you need to forgive him and deal kindly with him. \add If you do not forgive him\add*, he may become so sad that he will begin to  \add think that you will never forgive him\add* \f + \ft Or: will stop  \add believing in Christ\add* \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5  This person who fell into sin—he did not just make me sad by what he did; his sin made all of you sad.
\v 6  We all agree what we should do about this man and his sin. He has now been punished and his punishment was fair.
\v 7 So this is where we are now: he suffered through his punishment, but now it is time to forgive him for what he did and to love him so that he might not discouraged by feeling too sad.

\v 5 If anyone has caused pain, he has not caused it only to me, but in some measure—not to put it too harshly—to all of you.
\v 6 This punishment of that person by the majority is enough.
\v 7 So now rather than punishment, you should forgive and comfort him, so that he is not overwhelmed by too much sorrow.
