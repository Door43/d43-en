\v 5 I consider that \f + \ft litotes \f* none of those \add men, even though they think of themselves as being\add* \f + \ft irony \f* extra-special apostles, are in any way greater than I am.
\v 6 \add I admit that\add* I am not an eloquent speaker, but I do know \add God's message\add*. I have made that clear to you by everything \add that I have done among you and by all that I have taught you\add*.

\v 5 People call those teachers "super-apostles," but I do not think they are greater than I am.
\v 6 It may be true that I never studied how to give wonderful speeches, but I certainly know many things about God, as you learned when I spoke to you.

\v 5 For I think that I am not in the least inferior to those so-called super-apostles.
\v 6 But even if I am untrained in giving speeches, I am not untrained in knowledge. In every way and in all things we have made this known to you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **those so-called super-apostles** - Paul uses irony here to show that those teachers are less important then people say there are. AT: "those teachers whom some think are better than anyone else" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **I am not untrained in knowledge** - This negative phrase emphasizes the positive truth that he is trained in knowledge. The abstract noun "knowledge" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "I am certainly trained in knowledge" or "I am trained to know what they know" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
