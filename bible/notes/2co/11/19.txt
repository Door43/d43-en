\v 19 \add I am sure that you, who think that you are so wise, will accept what I say\add* because you gladly \add accept the\add* false teachers and the foolish things \add that they say\add*.
\v 20 When people \add treat\add* you as if they were your bosses, you gladly submit \add to them. You think that it is all right when others\add* force you provide for their needs. You think that it is all right\add when people\add* take control over you, when they boast about themselves, \add or when they insult you by\add* slapping you in the face.
\v 21 I agree that I was not bold enough to treat you in such ways. \add So do you think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* I should feel ashamed \add because I did not do that?\add*
\p So now, talking like a person who does not have any sense, I will boldly tell you \add some things about myself, just like those false apostles tell you things about themselves\add*.

\v 19 For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves.
\v 20 For you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he smiteth you on the face.
\v 21 I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whenever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.
