\v 27 in hard work and hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often hungry, in cold and nakedness.
\v 28 Besides from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my concern for all the churches.
\v 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who has led another to sin, and I do not burn with distress?
