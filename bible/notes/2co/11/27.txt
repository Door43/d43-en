<usfm>
\v 27 I have worked hard and been in hardship, often gone without sleep; I have been hungry and thirsty with nothing to eat. I have been cold and without enough clothing.
\v 28 In addition to all that, I worry every day about how well the churches are doing.
\v 29 There is no fellow believer who is weak, without me being weak with him. There is no fellow believer who has led another person into sin, without me being very angry about it.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 I have been at hard work and in hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, and nothing to eat, in cold and nakedness.
\v 28 And, apart from everything else, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches.
\v 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who has caused another to fall into sin, and I do not burn within?
