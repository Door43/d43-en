<usfm>
\v 1 \add But now, because my opponents are saying that Christ sent them to you as his representatives and that he did not send me\add*, please be patient with me, too, \add while I say a\add* few things \add that may sound as if\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add I am praising myself, like\add* a foolish person \add would do. You have been\add* \add putting up with\f + \ft Or: tolerating\add* \f* \add those who teach what is false;\add* now then, put up with\f + \ft Or: tolerate \f* me \add too\add*.
\v 2 I really do care about \add what happens to\add* you, just as God cares about \add what happens to you. Just like a father wants his daughter to be sexually pure when he presents her to the man she will marry\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, I \add want you to belong\add* to Christ \add alone and to no other\add*. I want to present you \add to him\add* as people who remain faithful to him \add only, and who have not believed the deceitful message of those who are teaching what is false\add*.

\v 1 It is foolish for a person to praise himself, but that is what I am doing. Please allow me to continue a little.
\v 2 For I want to guard you carefully. I want to guard you the way God himself would guard you. I am like a father who promised you in marriage to only one husband and who wants to be the one who presents you, as a pure virgin bride, to Christ.

\v 1 I wish that you could put up with me in some foolishness. But you are indeed putting up with me!
\v 2 For I am jealous about you. I have a godly jealousy for you, since I promised you in marriage to one husband. I promised to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to affirm his apostleship.

  * **put up with me in some foolishness** - "allow me to act like a fool"
  * **jealous ... jealousy** - These words speak of a good, strong desire that the Corinthians be faithful to Christ, and that no one should persuade them to leave him. 
  * **I promised you in marriage to one husband. I promised to present you as a pure virgin to Christ** - Paul speaks of his care for the Corinthian believers as if he had promised another man that he would prepare his daughter to marry him and he is most concerned that he be able to keep his promise to the man. AT: "I was like a father who promised to present his daughter to one husband. I promised to keep you as a pure virgin so I could give you to Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
