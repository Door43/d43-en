<usfm>
\v 1 \add But now, because my opponents are saying that Christ sent them to you as his representatives and that he did not send me\add*, please be patient with me, too, \add while I say a\add* few things \add that may sound as if\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add I am praising myself, like\add* a foolish person \add would do. You have been\add* \add putting up with\f + \ft Or: tolerating\add* \f* \add those who teach what is false;\add* now then, put up with\f + \ft Or: tolerate \f* me \add too\add*.
\v 2 I really do care about \add what happens to\add* you, just as God cares about \add what happens to you. Just like a father wants his daughter to be sexually pure when he presents her to the man she will marry\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, I \add want you to belong\add* to Christ \add alone and to no other\add*. I want to present you \add to him\add* as people who remain faithful to him \add only, and who have not believed the deceitful message of those who are teaching what is false\add*.

\v 1 It is foolish for a person to praise himself, but that is what I am doing. Please allow me to continue a little.
\v 2 For I know that there are other rivals to me that you are considering, and I am jealous for you—jealous to God for you. I am like a father who promised you in marriage to only one husband and who wants to be the one who presents you, as a pure virgin bride, to Christ.

\v 1 I wish that you could put up with me in some foolishness—but you are indeed putting up with me!
\v 2 For I am jealous about you—I have a godly jealousy for you, since I promised you in marriage to one husband—to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
