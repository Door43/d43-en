\v 14 I am not surprised \add that they act like that\add*, because Satan himself causes people to think \add that he has come\add* as a shining messenger \add from God\add*.
\v 15 So it should not surprise \add you\add* if these men, who \add really\add* serve \add Satan, do good deeds in order\add* to make you think they \add serve God\add*. Some day God will \add punish them\add* according to what they deserve because of their\add evil\add* deeds.

\v 14 They should not surprise us. Even Satan pretends to be an angel shining with the light of God's presence.
\v 15 His servants also pretend to serve God; they pretend to be good. God will punish them as they deserve.

\v 14 And this is no surprise, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
\v 15 It is no great surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their fate will be what their deeds deserve.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this is no surprise ... It is no great surprise if** - By stating this in a negative form Paul is emphasizing that the Corinthians should expect to meet many "false apostles" ([[:en:bible:notes:2co:11:12|11:13]]). AT: "we should expect this ... We should certainly expect that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **Satan disguises himself as an angel of light** - "Satan is not an angel of light, but he tries to make himself look like an angel of light"
  * **his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness** - "his servants are not servants of righteousness, but they try to make themselves look like servants of righteousness"
