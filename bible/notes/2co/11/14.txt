\v 15 So it should not surprise \add you\add* if these men, who \add really\add* serve \add Satan, do good deeds in order\add* to make you think they \add serve God\add*. Some day God will \add punish them\add* according to what they deserve because of their\add evil\add* deeds.

\v 14 They should not surprise us. Even Satan pretends to be an angel shining with the light of God's presence.
\v 15 His servants also pretend to serve God; they pretend to be good. God will punish them like they deserve.

\v 14 And this is no surprise, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
\v 15 It is no great surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their fate will be what their deeds deserve.
