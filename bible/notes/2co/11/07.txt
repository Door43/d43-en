\v 7 \add I refused to accept money\add* from you as pay for teaching you God's message about Christ. It is ridiculous for you to think that what I did was wrong!\f + \ft Or: Was that wrong? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I know that by teaching you without pay\add*, I made myself seem \f + \ft irony \f* unimportant to you. \add But I did it\add* to honor you.
\v 8 \add Some people might say that it was as though\add* \f + \ft irony \f* I was robbing other congregations because I accepted money from them in order that I might work among you.
\v 9 Furthermore, when I was \add there\add* with you and had no \add money to buy the things that I needed\add*, I did not cause any difficulty to any \add of you\add* \add by depending on you\f + \ft Or: by asking you for money, Or: support\add* \f*, because our\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* fellow believers who came from \add here in\add* Macedonia \add province\add* brought enough \add money for me to buy everything\add* that I needed. So I have not caused you any difficulty at all \add by asking you for money\add*, and I never will \add ask you for money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*.

\v 7 Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?
\v 8 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them that I might minister to you;
\v 9 and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from
Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.
