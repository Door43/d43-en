\v 7 \add I refused to accept money\add* from you as pay for teaching you God's message about Christ. It is ridiculous for you to think that what I did was wrong!\f + \ft Or: Was that wrong? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I know that by teaching you without pay\add*, I made myself seem \f + \ft irony \f* unimportant to you. \add But I did it\add* to honor you.
\v 8 \add Some people might say that it was as though\add* \f + \ft irony \f* I was robbing other congregations because I accepted money from them in order that I might work among you.
\v 9 Furthermore, when I was \add there\add* with you and had no \add money to buy the things that I needed\add*, I did not cause any difficulty to any \add of you\add* \add by depending on you\f + \ft Or: by asking you for money, Or: support\add* \f*, because our\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* fellow believers who came from \add here in\add* Macedonia \add province\add* brought enough \add money for me to buy everything\add* that I needed. So I have not caused you any difficulty at all \add by asking you for money\add*, and I never will \add ask you for money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*.

\v 7 Was I wrong to serve you as a humble person in such a way that others praised you instead of me? Was I wrong to preach the good news to you without charging any money?
\v 8 Yes, I allowed believers in other churches to give me money so I could serve you. Maybe you will say that I was robbing them. But I asked you for nothing.
\v 9 There was a time when I was with you that I needed many things, but I did not ask you for any money at all. The brothers who came from Macedonia provided all I needed, instead. I have done everything I could for you not to be in hardship because of me, and this I will continue to do.

\v 7 Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted, because I freely preached the gospel of God to you?
\v 8 I "robbed" other churches, accepting support from them so that I could serve you.
\v 9 And when I was with you and I was in need, I did not burden anyone. For the brothers who came from  Macedonia provided what I needed. And in every way I kept myself from being a burden to you, and I will continue to do that.
