\v 7 Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted, because I freely preached the gospel of God to you?
\v 8 I "robbed" other churches, accepting support from them so that I could serve you.
\v 9 And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone. For the brothers who came from  Macedonia supplied what I needed. And in every way I kept myself from being a bother to you,  and that I will continue to do.
