<usfm>
\v 12 I am happy \add to say\add* that I have behaved toward all people \f + \ft metonymy \f* in an honest and sincere way. I am sure within myself \add that this is true\add*. Especially, I have behaved toward you \add honestly and sincerely because that is what\add* God wants us to do. As I have done that, \add my thoughts\add* have not been the thoughts that unbelieving people \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add think are\add* wise. Instead, \add I have behaved toward people only as God wants me to, depending on\add* God to help me in ways that I do not deserve.
\v 13 \add I say that\add* because \add in all my letters to you\add* I have always written \f + \ft litotes \f* clearly in a way that you can easily and completely understand \add when you\add* read them.
\v 14 \add Previously some of\add* you, but not all of you, have completely understood \add that I am always honest and sincere with you\add*. But I confidently expect that \add soon\add* you will all be fully convinced \add about that\add*. Then when the Lord Jesus \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add returns, you will all be able to say that\add* you are pleased with me, just like I will \add be able to say that\add* I am pleased with you.

<usfm>
\v 12 We can very happily say that we have we lived toward all people in an honest and sincere way. We lived in the world as God's own people and we have deep trust in God, that was a gift from him. We do not live in any way that the world values. We do not listen to the world's wisdom when we choose what we will do. Instead, God has made us honest and holy in how we live.
\v 13 You have read my letters. I have written them so you can understand them.
\v 14 You know a little about us already, but on the day when the Lord Jesus returns, I hope that you will be very proud of us in his presence, and we will be very proud of you.

\v 12 We are proud of this: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world with holiness and godly sincerity, especially in relations with you, not relying on fleshly wisdom but on the grace of God.
\v 13 We write to you nothing that you cannot read and understand. I hope that,
\v 14 as you have understood us in part, we will be your reason for boasting on the day of our Lord Jesus, just as you will be our reason to boast.
