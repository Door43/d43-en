===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 So now \add I will tell you why I changed my mind and did not visit you as I intended to do\add*: God himself knows \add that what I am telling you is true\add*. The reason that I did not return to Corinth was so that I might not have to \add speak to you severely about the wrong that you had done\add*.
\v 24 It is not that Silas, Timothy and I want to boss you \add and tell you that you must\add* believe only what we say. \add Not at all!\add* On the contrary, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are working as partners \add with you\add* in order to make you happy. \add We do not try to force you to believe everything that we believe, because we are sure that you are continuing to\add* trust \add the Lord Jesus Christ\add* and that you are remaining firmly committed to him.

<usfm>
\v 23 May God himself assure you about my reason for not coming to you, Christians in Corinth: It was so that you would not have to face me giving correction to you.
\v 24 We are not like masters who give you orders about how you must trust in God. However, we want to work with you, so you can learn to trust God no matter what happens, and have joy in trusting him.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 23 Instead, I call God to bear witness for me that the reason I did not come to Corinth was so that I might spare you.
\v 24 This is not because we are trying to control what your faith should be. Instead, we are working with you for your joy, as you stand in your faith.
</usfm>
