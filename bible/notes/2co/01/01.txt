\v 1 I, Paul, together with Timothy our brother, write this letter to you. Christ Jesus sent me to serve him and to obey God's will. We are sending this letter to those who come together as God's people in the city of Corinth; we are also sending it to the all Christians who live in the region of Achaia—people whom God has set apart for himself.
\v 2 May God give you the free gifts of his love and peace—these things that come from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

  * **Timothy our brother** - This indicates that both Paul and the Corinthians knew Timothy and considered him to be their spiritual brother.
  * **Achaia** - This is the name of a Roman province in the southern part of modern-day Greece. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
