\v 1 I, Paul, together with Timothy, our Christian brother, write this letter to you. Christ Jesus sent me to serve him and to obey God's will. We are sending this letter to those who come together as God's people in the city of Corinth; we are also sending it to the all Christians who live in the region of Achaia—people whom God has set apart for himself.
\v 2 May God give you the free gifts of his love and peace—these things that come from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Paul**  - "From Paul." Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. This could be translated as "I, Paul, wrote this letter."
  * **brother** - In the New Testament, the apostles often used the word "brother" to refer to fellow Christians, since all believers in Christ are members of one spiritual family, with God as their heavenly Father.
    * **Achaia**  - This is the name of a Roman province in the southern part of modern day Greece. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **Grace to you and peace** - The word "you" refers to the people of the church in Corinth and to the rest of the Christians in that area. This is a common greeting used by Paul in his letters.
