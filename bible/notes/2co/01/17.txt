\v 17 So then, even though I \add changed my mind later and did not do what\add* I \add first\add* planned to do, \add it was not because I did not have an important reason for changing my plans\add*. Surely you do not\add really think\add* that I decide on what I am going to do like people who do not know God do!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add really think\add* that I decide on what I am going to do like people who do not know God do? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I am \add not like that\add*. I am not \add a person who\add* says \add to people\add*, "Yes, \add certainly I will do that\add*," and then \add for no good reason changes his mind and says\add*, "No, \add I will not do it\add*."
\v 18 Just as surely as God always does what he says \add he will do, it is true that I have never said\add*, "Yes, \add I will do this\add*" when I \add really meant\add* "No."

\v 17 My mind was made up that this would be the plan. I was not telling you "Yes" and then telling you "No." I was not making my plans like unbelievers often make plans.
\v 18 But God is faithful in guiding us, and we do not confuse you, either. We are making our plans and staying with them.

\v 17 When I was thinking this way, did I vacillate? Or do I plan things according to human standards, so that I say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time?
\v 18 But just as God is faithful, we do not say both "Yes" and "No."

  * **Or do I plan things according to human standards, so that that I say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time?**  - Paul defends his integrity.
