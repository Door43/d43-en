\v 8 \add Our\add* fellow believers, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* want you to know \f + \ft litotes \f* about the trouble that we suffered in Asia \add province\add*. That trouble was so very great that it was much more than we were able to endure. As a result, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* thought that we would certainly die.
\v 9 Indeed, we felt \add like a person feels when he has heard a judge say\add*, "I condemn you to die\f + \ft Or: be \f* executed \f + \ft metaphor \f*." But \add God allowed us to think that we were going to die\add* so that we would not rely on\f + \ft Or: trust in \f* our own \add strength. He wanted us\add* instead\add to rely\add* only on his \add strength, because he\add* is the one who \add has power even to make\add* those who have died live \add again\add*.
\v 10 And \add even though\add* we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* were \add in terrible danger and were\add* about to die, God rescued us. And he will continue to rescue us\add whenever we are in trouble\add*. We confidently expect that he will continue to rescue us \add time after time\add*.

\v 8 Brothers and sisters in Christ, we want you to know about the trouble we had Asia. The trouble there was so very great it nearly destroyed us. It was more than we could endure. It was so difficult we did not want to live.
\v 9 Indeed, we had the sentence of death on us, we were waiting to be killed. That sentence of death taught us not to rely on our own strength but on God who raises the dead back to life.
\v 10 God rescued us from these terrible dangers, dangers that could have killed us, and he will rescue us in the future. We confidently expect that he will rescue us, and he can be trusted to deliver us from danger.

<usfm>
\v 8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about the troubles we had in Asia, that we were completely crushed beyond what we could bear, so much that we did not even want to live.
\v 9  Indeed, we had the sentence of death on us. But that was to make us not lay our trust on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.
\v 10 He rescued us from such a deadly peril, and he will rescue us. We have set our hope on him that yet again, he will deliver us,
</usfm>
