\v 8 \add Our\add* fellow believers, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* want you to know \f + \ft litotes \f* about the trouble that we suffered in Asia \add province\add*. That trouble was so very great that it was much more than we were able to endure. As a result, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* thought that we would certainly die.
\v 9 Indeed, we felt \add like a person feels when he has heard a judge say\add*, "I condemn you to die\f + \ft Or: be \f* executed \f + \ft metaphor \f*." But \add God allowed us to think that we were going to die\add* so that we would not rely on\f + \ft Or: trust in \f* our own \add strength. He wanted us\add* instead\add to rely\add* only on his \add strength, because he\add* is the one who \add has power even to make\add* those who have died live \add again\add*.
\v 10 And \add even though\add* we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* were \add in terrible danger and were\add* about to die, God rescued us. And he will continue to rescue us\add whenever we are in trouble\add*. We confidently expect that he will continue to rescue us \add time after time\add*.

\v 8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about the troubles we had in Asia, that we were completely crushed beyond what we could bear, so much that we did not even want to live.
\v 9 We actually felt that we have had the sentence of death on us, so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,
\v 10 who rescued us from such a great peril of death, and will rescue us again, and who we hope and trust that he will continue to rescue us.
