<usfm>
\v 8 \add Our\add* fellow believers, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* want you to know \f + \ft litotes \f* about the trouble that we suffered in Asia \add province\add*. That trouble was so very great that it was much more than we were able to endure. As a result, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* thought that we would certainly die.
\v 9 Indeed, we felt \add like a person feels when he has heard a judge say\add*, "I condemn you to die\f + \ft Or: be \f* executed \f + \ft metaphor \f*." But \add God allowed us to think that we were going to die\add* so that we would not rely on\f + \ft Or: trust in \f* our own \add strength. He wanted us\add* instead\add to rely\add* only on his \add strength, because he\add* is the one who \add has power even to make\add* those who have died live \add again\add*.
\v 10 And \add even though\add* we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* were \add in terrible danger and were\add* about to die, God rescued us. And he will continue to rescue us\add whenever we are in trouble\add*. We confidently expect that he will continue to rescue us \add time after time\add*.

<usfm>
\v 8 Brothers and sisters in Christ, we want you to know about the trouble we had in the province of Asia. That trouble gave us such pain that we could not bear it. We were almost certain that we were going to die.
\v 9 They pronounced the sentence of death on us; we were waiting to be killed. That sentence of death taught us not to rely on our own strength but on God, who raises the dead and brings them back to life.
\v 10 But God rescued us from those terrible dangers, and he promises to rescue us in the future.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about the troubles we had in Asia. We were completely crushed beyond what we could bear, so much that we did not even hope to live any longer.
\v 9 Indeed, we had the sentence of death on us. But that was to make us not put our trust in ourselves, but instead in God, who raises the dead.
\v 10 He rescued us from such a deadly peril, and he will rescue us again. We have set our confidence in him that he will deliver us yet again.
</usfm>
