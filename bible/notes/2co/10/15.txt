====== 2 Corinthians 10:15-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Also, \add my opponents\add* boast about work that others have done \add as if it were their own work\add*. It is improper for them to do that, but I do not do as they do. I confidently expect that as you trust more and more \add in the good message that I preach\add*, you will more and more \add agree that God has given me the right to\add* work \add as Christ's representative\add* among you.
\v 16 Then I will be able to go to places beyond where you \add are\add*. I will be able to tell the good message about Christ \add to people in areas where no one has yet gone to tell that message\add*. And \add I will be able to talk about the work I myself have done in that area\add*, instead of boasting about work that someone else has already done \add as if it were my work\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 We are not boasting about the work God gave to others, as if we had done that work. Instead, we hope that you will trust God more and more, and that in the same way, God will assign us a larger region to work in.
\v 16 We hope for this, in order that we may share the good news with people beyond where you live. We will not take credit for work that any other servants of God are doing, in their own regions where they serve him.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 We have not boasted beyond limits about the labors of others. Instead, we hope as your faith grows that our own area of work will be greatly expanded, and still within its proper limits.
\v 16 We hope for this, so that we may preach the gospel even in regions beyond you. We will not boast about the work being done in another's area.
