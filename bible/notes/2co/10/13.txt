====== 2 Corinthians 10:13-14 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 But as for me, I will not boast about \add working among people living in\add* areas outside of the areas \add that God sent\f + \ft Or: assigned \f* me to work in\add*. But \add it is right for\add* me to say that \add I have worked\add* in the areas that God assigned to me. \add And since those areas\add* include the one where you live,
\v 14 \add when I talk about working among you\add*, I am not boasting \add about working in an area where God did not give me the right to work. What those who oppose me say about my not having authority as an apostle to you might be true\add* if I had not already come all the way to your area. \add But that is not true\add*, because I was the one who first brought the message about Christ to you. \add I came to Corinth before they did\add*!

\v 13 We will praise ourselves only about what God has given us to do. And we will work only as he has told us to work; our work, however, includes you also.
\v 14 When we reached out to you, we did not go beyond where God assigned us to work. He assigned your region to us, and we were the first to tell you the Good News about  Christ.

<usfm>
\v 13 We, however, will not boast beyond limits, but we will keep in the area that God has assigned to us, even to reach as far as to you.
\v 14 For we did not overextend ourselves when we reached you, and we were the first to reach as far as you with the gospel of Christ.
