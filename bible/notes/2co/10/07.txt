<usfm>
\v 7 \add I want you to understand what is\add* happening among you. There are certain \add people there who are telling you that\add* they know for sure that they are Christ's \add representatives and that I am not\add*. Those people should realize that I \add represent\add* Christ as much as they do.
\v 8 \add I say that\add* because the authority that the Lord gave me \add as his apostle\add* is to help you to become mature believers, not to cause you to stop \add trusting in Christ\add*. So even if I were to boast a little more than I have \add already done\add* \f + \ft Or: proudly talk a little more than I have \add already talked\add* about the authority the Lord gave me \add as his apostle\add* \f*, \add no one would be able to make me\add* ashamed \add by proving that Jesus has not given me that authority\add*.

\v 7 Take time to see what is being shown to you, it is right before your eyes: If anyone has that faith that gives confidence that you belong to Christ, that person should let us remind him, that just as he is Christ's, so are we!
\v 8 My boasting about my apostolic authority may have been too much for you, but the Lord gave that authority to me not to intimidate you or to tear you down, but to help build you up. But I am not ashamed of the authority the Lord gave me.

\v 7 You see according to appearances. If any man is convinced he is Christ’s, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.
\v 8 For even if I boast excessively about our authority, which the Lord gave to build you up and not to destroy you, I will not be ashamed.
