\v 9 I do not intend to make you afraid of me by the letters that I \add write to you\add*.
\v 10 \add I say that\add* because some people are saying, "\add When Paul writes\add* letters, he says severe things \add in order to make you obey him\add*, but when he is here with you, \add people look at him and say\add* he is weak, and he certainly is not a skillful speaker."

<usfm>
\v 9 Though my letters seem strong when you read them, I do not want you to be afraid when you read them. That is not why I have written them to you.
\v 10 Some people who know me and read my letters say, "We should take his letters seriously because they say powerful things, but when Paul is with us, he is physically weak and he is not worth listening to."
