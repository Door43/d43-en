\q If anyone wants to boast \add about something\add*, he should boast \add only\add* about what the Lord \add God has done\add*.
\p
\v 18 \add You can realize, then, that\add* it is not those who praise themselves\f + \ft Or: tell you what great things they have done \f*, \add as my opponents do\add*, whom you should accept \add as apostles\add*. Instead, you \add should accept as true apostles only\add* those whom the Lord commends.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 The scriptures say,
\q "Let the one who is proud, be proud of the Lord."
\p
\v 18 When a person praises himself for what he has done, God does not reward him for doing that. Instead, he rewards those whom he approves.

\q
\v 17 "But let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
\m
\v 18 For it is not the one who recommends himself who is approved. Instead, it is the one whom the Lord recommends.
