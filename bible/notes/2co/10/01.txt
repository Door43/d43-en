\v 1 Now, I Paul, myself encourage you, by the humility and kindness of Christ--I who am meek when in your presence, but bold toward you when absent--
\v 2 I ask, that I when I am present I do not need to be bold with the confidence that I consider to be daring against some, who consider us as if we acted according to human standards.
