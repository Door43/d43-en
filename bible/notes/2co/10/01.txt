====== 2 Corinthians 10:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Now I myself, Paul, appeal to you in a gentle and humble way, like Christ \add would. Certain people among you have falsely accused me by saying\add*, "When \add Paul\add* is with you, he is humble \add and speaks gently\add* to you, but when he is away from you, \add in the letters he writes to you\add* he threatens \add to punish\add* you." \add Those people claim that I do not have authority over you as an apostle\add*.
\v 2 I strongly plead with you, "\add Please do not listen to people who say things like that!\add*" \add I strongly plead with you to not listen to them\add*, so that when I am there \add with you\add* I will not \add need to\add* speak severely \add to you\add* in the same severe way as I \add plan to\add* speak to those people who think that I behave like people who are not believers.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Now I, Paul, beg of you—and I am humble and gentle as I do so, because Christ has made me that way: I, who was shy when I was in front of you, but forceful when I am writing you a letter from far away:
\v 2 I beg of you that, when I come, I will not have to be harsh with you. I am afraid, however, that I will have to be, in order to speak against the people who think that we work with human standards.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 I, Paul, myself appeal to you, by the humility and gentleness of Christ. I am meek when I am in your presence, but I am bold toward you when I am away.
\v 2 I beg of you that, when I am present with you, I will not need to be bold with self-confidence. But I think I will need to be bold when I oppose those who assume that we are living according to the flesh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul shifts the subject from giving to affirming his authority to teach as he does. 

  * **by the humility and gentleness of Christ** - The word "humility" and "gentleness" are abstract nouns, and can be expressed in another way. AT: "I am humble and gentle as I do so, because Christ has made me that way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **who assume that** - "who think that"
  * **we are living according to the flesh** - The word "flesh" is a metonym for sinful human nature. "we are acting from human motives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
