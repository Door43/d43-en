\v 1 I, Paul, myself appeal to you, by the humility and gentleness of Christ—I who am meek when in your presence, but bold toward you when away—
\v 2 I beg of you that when I am present, I would not need to be bold with the self-confidence that I consider to be daring, when I oppose those who think we are living according to the standards of this world.
