====== 2 Corinthians 10:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 1 Now I myself, Paul, appeal to you in a gentle and humble way, like Christ \add would. Certain people among you have falsely accused me by saying\add*, "When \add Paul\add* is with you, he is humble \add and speaks gently\add* to you, but when he is away from you, \add in the letters he writes to you\add* he threatens \add to punish\add* you." \add Those people claim that I do not have authority over you as an apostle\add*. \v 2 I strongly plead with you, "\add Please do not listen to people who say things like that!\add*" \add I strongly plead with you to not listen to them\add*, so that when I am there \add with you\add* I will not \add need to\add* speak severely \add to you\add* in the same severe way as I \add plan to\add* speak to those people who think that I behave like people who are not believers. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 Now I, Paul, beg of you—and I am humble and gentle as I do so, because Christ has made me that way: I, who was shy when I was in front of you, but forceful when I am writing you a letter from far away: \v 2 I beg of you that, when I come, I will not have to be harsh with you. I am afraid, however, that I will have to be, in order to speak against the people who think that we work with human standards. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \c 10 \p \v 1 I, Paul, myself appeal to you, by the humility and gentleness of Christ—I who am meek when in your presence, but bold toward you when away— \v 2 I beg of you that, when I am present with you, I will not need to be bold with self-confidence, as I think I will have to be , when I oppose those who suppose that we are living according to the flesh. </usfm>
