\v 8 Even though what \add I wrote\add* in my letter distressed you\f + \ft Or: made you sad \f*, I am not sorry \add that I wrote it\add*. For a while I was sorry that I had written it, \add because I knew that it would distress you\add*. Now \add Titus has also told\add* me that it did distress you \add when you read it\add*, but you were distressed only for a short time.
\v 9 \add So now\add* I am happy \add that I wrote it\add*. I am not happy that you were distressed \f + \ft Or:that \add I\add* distressed you \f*, but \add I am happy\add* because, when you became distressed, you became sorry for what you had done and \add you asked God to forgive you. What I mean is that you became sorry in the way that God wanted you to be sorry, so my making\add* you sorry did not harm you at all.
\v 10 \add The fact is that\add* when God causes \add us to be\add* truly sorry for having sinned and we turn from our sinful behavior, then God saves us \add and will not punish us for the sinful things that we have done\add*. And no one is ever sorry about that. \add However\add*, the people who do not trust \add in God\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* may be sorry \add for the sinful things that they have done\add*. But \add if they do not turn from their sinful behavior and ask God to forgive them\add*, they will remain separated from him forever.

\v 8 I know the letter I wrote to you made you sad, but I had to write it. I did regret it when I wrote it, but what I wrote to you was necessary to help you deal with the problems in the church. I knew that your sorrow would last only for a short time.
\v 9 And so now I can rejoice, not because you were sad when you read my letter, but because your sorrow turned you away from the sin that was hurting you so much, and it changed your sadness into a sorrow that God brought to you, a sorrow that gave you so much more than you had lost.
\v 10 This kind of sorrow turns a person away from sin so that God can rescue him; people are glad, in the end, to have had this kind of sorrow. On the other hand, worldly sorrow, a sadness for your sins only because you were caught in them, can lead only to death.

\v 8 Even if my letter made you sad, I do not regret it—though I did regret it when I saw my letter made you sad, but sad just for a little while—
\v 9 and now I rejoice, not that you were distressed, but that your sadness brought you to repentance. You experienced a godly sorrow, so you suffered no loss because of us.
\v 10 For godly sorrow brings about repentance that accomplishes salvation without regret; worldly sorrow, however, brings about death.
