====== 2 Corinthians 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter has a very abrupt change. In 7:2-4, Paul finishes his defense. He then talks about Titus' return and the comfort it brought.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Clean and unclean == 

Christians are "clean" in the sense that they are in a right relationship with God, and they do not need to be concerned with being clean according the Law of Moses. Ungodly living can still make a Christian unclean. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:clean|Clean]], [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]], [[:en:obe:kt:ungodly|Ungodly]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unclean|unclean]])

== Sadness and sorrow ==
Different terms for emotions can have great differences in meaning. The terms "sad" and "sorrow" in this chapter indicates that the Corinthians were upset to the point of repentance. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent|Repentance]]) 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== We ==

It is likely that Paul's usage of the pronoun "we" represents at least Timothy and himself. It is possible that it may also include other people.

== Original situation ==

This chapter discusses in detail a previous situation. Although some aspects of this situation can be assumed given the information in this chapter, it is best to leave this type of implicit information untranslated. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
