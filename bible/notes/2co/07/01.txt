\v 1 My friends, whom I love, because \add God\add* has promised like this \add to accept us\f + \ft inclusive \f* as his children\add*, we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* must stop doing anything that is sinful. We must not do sinful things with our bodies, and we must not \add think\add* sinful thoughts. \add Because\add* we greatly revere God, we must strive to \add live\add* a completely pure life. By doing that we will become the kind of people that he wants us to be.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Dear ones whom God loves, since God has given us these promises, let us remove from ourselves all moral filth and anything that would stand in the way of our worship of God. Let us clean ourselves outwardly and inwardly, in body and in spirit, as we cautiously move toward our God who is holy, and we tremble because he requires us to be holy as well. God is not like us, he has all holiness in himself and God's difference from us makes us tremble in fear of him who loves us.
