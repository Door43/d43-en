\v 11 But \add think about what happened when you read my letter\add*. God caused you to be truly sorry \add for what you had done\add*. You eagerly \add wanted to do what was right\add*, and you wanted to show \add God\add* (OR\add , me\add*) that you had done the right thing. You were angry \add about what had happened\add*, and you were worried \add that God would punish you if the situation continued\add*. You also wanted me \add to visit you to encourage and help you\add*. You wanted me to know \add that you really do accept me as your apostle, and that you punished the man who had sinned as I told you to do. By doing\add* all of those things, you have shown \add me\add* that you have done what is right in this matter.
\v 12 So, even though I wrote that \add severe\add* letter to you, I did not \add write it just\add* so that \add you would punish\add* the man who had done what was wrong. Also, I \add did not write it\add* for the benefit of the person whom \add he\add* had wronged. Instead, \add I wrote it\add* so that, when you \add read the letter\add*, God would enable you to realize how much you really do respect \add my authority\add*.

\v 11 But think about what happened when you read my letter. God caused you to be truly sorry for what you had done. You eagerly wanted to do what was right, and you wanted to show God (OR, me) that you had done the right thing. You were angry about what had happened, and you were worried that God would punish you if the situation continued. You also wanted me to visit you to encourage and help you. You wanted me to know that you really do accept me as your apostle, and that you punished the man who had sinned as I told you to do. By doing all of those things, you have shown me that you have done what is right in this matter.
\v 12 So, even though I wrote that severe letter to you, I did not write it just so that you would punish the man who had done what was wrong. Also, I did not write it for the benefit of the person whom he had wronged. Instead, I wrote it so that, when you read the letter, God would enable you to realize how much you really do respect my authority.

\v 11 For behold, this selfsame thing, that you were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it wrought in you, youa
what clearing of yourselves, yes what indignation, yes what fear, yes what longing, yes what zeal, yes what avenging! In everything you approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.
\v 12 So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest to you in the sight of God.
