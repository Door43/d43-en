\v 5 Now \add I will write more about what I was saying about Titus\add*. When I \add left Troas and\add* came \add here to\add* Macedonia \add province\add*, I still did not get rest for my body. Everywhere we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* went, \add people were constantly\add* causing us trouble. \add And not only were\add* people \add constantly causing us\add* trouble, but I was greatly concerned \add about you all\add*.
\v 6 But God, who always encourages his people when they are discouraged, encouraged us by \add sending\add* Titus back to us.
\v 7 I was encouraged by\add seeing\add* Titus\add , but when I heard how\add* you had encouraged him, that encouraged me even more. He told me how much you wanted \add to see me. He told me\add* that you were very sorry \add that you had made me so unhappy. He also told me\add* that you are very eager for me \add to continue to serve as your apostle. When Titus told me those things\add*, I was very, very happy.

\v 5 When we came to you in Macedonia, we were exhausted. We had troubles on every side—we faced hardships from other people and conflict with authorities, and we were filled with such fears on the inside that we were overwhelmed by those fears.
\v 6 But God always comforts us when we are discouraged, and he comforted us at this time by sending Titus to be with us.
\v 7 Titus's coming was a great comfort to us, but you also comforted him when you were with him, and when he came to us he told us of your deep love for me, how you mourned for me in my afflictions, and the deep zeal you have in your concern for me, and so I rejoice even more about you.

\v 5 When we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were troubled in every way—conflicts on the outside and fears on the inside.
\v 6 But God, who comforts the discouraged, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,
\v 7 and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort he received from you, when he told us of your great affection, your mourning, and your deep concerned for me, and so I rejoiced even more.
