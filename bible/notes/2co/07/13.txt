\v 13 By all of this we are very encouraged!
\p We were so happy about what Titus told us, and we were also happy because you had given him rest and helped him.
\v 14 I told him very good things about you, how proud I was of you, and you did not put me to shame when he came to you. We praised you so much to Titus, and you proved it was all true!

<usfm>
\v 13 By this we are encouraged.
\p
In addition to our own comfort, we also rejoiced even more because of Titus' joy, because his spirit was refreshed by all of you.
\v 14 For if I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame. On the contrary, just as everything we said to you was true, our boasting about you to Titus proved to be true.
