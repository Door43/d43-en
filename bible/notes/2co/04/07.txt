\v 7 \add This work that God has given to\add* us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* is \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like\add* a very valuable treasure. But we who have that treasure \add are as weak as fragile\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* clay pots. \add God has planned it like that\add* in order that \add people\add* will know that the power \add that changes lives\add* is God's power, and not any power of our own.
\v 8 We are continually oppressed \f + \ft Or:\add People\add* continually oppress us \f* in many ways, but \add we have\add* not been prevented \f + \ft Or:\add God has\add* not \add allowed them to\add* prevent us \f* \add from teaching the message about Jesus Christ\add*. We often do not know what to do \add in difficult situations\add*, but we never say, "God has abandoned us."
\v 9 \add We are frequently\add* persecuted \f + \ft Or:\add People frequently\add* cause us to suffer \f*, but \add God\add* never leaves us alone. \add Sometimes we are\add* badly wounded \f + \ft Or:\add people\add* badly wound us \f*, but \add God does\add* not \add allow\add* us\add to\add* be killed \f + \ft Or:\add them to\add* kill us \f*.
\v 10 \add Wherever we\f + \ft exclusive \f* go\add*, we continually \add realize that because people killed\add* Jesus, \add people may\add* kill us \add for teaching his message. But we are willing to go on living this way\add* in order that \add people\add* will know that Jesus is alive and \add that he is directing\add* us \f + \ft synecdoche \f*.

\v 7 Now we carry these precious gifts from God in our bodies, which are fragile like clay pots. There can be no mistake about where our strength comes from: it comes only from God.
\v 8 We have suffered many different kinds of trouble, but they have not destroyed us. We may be confused about what we should do, but we never give up.
\v 9 Some people try to harm us, but we are never alone; it is as if some people knocked us down, but we always get up again.
\v 10 We are often in danger of dying, as Jesus died, but our bodies will live again, because Jesus is alive.

\v 7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay, so that it is clear that the exceedingly great power belongs to God and not to us.
\v 8 We are afflicted in every way, but not overwhelmed. We are perplexed but not filled with despair.
\v 9 We are persecuted but not forsaken. We are struck down but not destroyed.
\v 10 We always carry in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be shown in our bodies.
