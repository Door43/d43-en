\v 7 \add This work that God has given to\add* us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* is \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like\add* a very valuable treasure.

We often do not know what to do \add in difficult situations\add*, but we never say, "God has abandoned us."

\v 7 Now we carry these precious gifts from God in our bodies, which are fragile like clay pots. There there can be no mistake about where our strength come from: it comes only from God.
\v 8 We have suffered many different kinds of trouble, but they have not destroyed us. We may be confused about what we should do, but we never give up.
\v 9 Some people try to harm us, but we are never alone; it is as if some people knocked us down, but we always get up again.
\v 10 We are often in danger of dying, as Jesus dies, but our bodies will live again, because Jesus is alive.

\v 7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay, so that it is clear that the exceedingly great power belongs to God and not to us.
\v 8 We are afflicted in every way, but not overwhelmed. We are perplexed but not filled with despair;
\v 9 persecuted but not forsaken; struck down but not destroyed.
\v 10 We always carry in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be shown in our bodies.
