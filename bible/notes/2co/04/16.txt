<usfm>
\v 16 So, \add because we know that as a result of our suffering many people will honor God\add*, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* never get so discouraged \add that we stop teaching his message\add*. Although our bodies are getting weaker, \add God\add* encourages us every day and strengthens us in our inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*.
\v 17 \add I know that\add* all these troubles that \add happen to us in this life are\add* not significant and will not last forever. \add When we think of\add* the glorious things \add that God is preparing\add* for us \add to enjoy\add* forever \add in heaven\add*, all \add our suffering now\add* is not important.
\v 18 That is why we say, "We will not continue thinking about \add all the suffering that we\add* are experiencing now. Even though \add we\add* cannot see \add all the things that God has prepared for us in heaven\add*, those are what we should be thinking about." \add That is how we should think\add*, because \add all these troubles\add* that \add we\f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* have \add now\add* will last only a short time. But what \add we will have in heaven\add*, what \add we\add* cannot see \add now\add*, will last forever.

\v 16 We are not discouraged. When our bodies are dying a little each day outwardly, God is making us new every day on in the inside.
\v 17 For these short, easy times of suffering are getting us ready for the day when God will make us wonderful forever, wonderful in ways that no one can measure or explain.
\v 18 For we are not waiting for things that we can see, but for the things we cannot see. The things that we can now see are temporary, but the things we cannot see, they last forever.

\p
\v 16 So we do not become discouraged. Even though outwardly we are wasting away, inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
\v 17 For this momentary, light affliction  is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory that exceeds all measurement.
\v 18 For we are not watching for things that are seen, but for things which are unseen. The things which we can see are temporary, but the things which are unseen are eternal.

    * **outwardly we are wasting away** - This phrase refers to Paul and Timothy's appearance from the outside of their bodies. "wasting away" refers to someone whose body has lost it's healthy appearance. 
    * **inwardly we are being renewed day by day** - The word "inwardly" refers to the inner man where they think.  The word "renewed" refers to their thoughts being made positive again.
    * **for an eternal weight of glory that exceeds all measurement**  - The glory of Paul and Timothy is referred to as a weight so heavy that cannot be measured.  This is another way to say they will be greatly honored for what they have done. AT: "to be greatly honored in heaven forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

    * **for things which are unseen** - This refers to rewards in heaven.   AT: "great rewards in heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) It is understood from the previous phrase that this is what Paul and Timothy are watching for. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
