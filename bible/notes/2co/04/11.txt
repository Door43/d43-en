====== 2 Corinthians 04:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 \add So, although\add* we are \add still\add* alive, we always realize that we may be killed \f + \ft Or:that \add people some day\add* may kill us \f* because \add we teach about\add* Jesus. \add God allows us to suffer\add* in order that \add people\add* will see that Jesus is alive and that he is \add strengthening\add* our bodies that are some day going to die.
\v 12 So \add I conclude that although\add* we \add apostles\add* are constantly \add suffering and may soon\add* die, \add the result of that is that all of\add* you \add have now received eternal\add* life.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 For those of us who are alive, God is always leading us to face death because we are joined to Jesus, so that when people look at us, they can know that Jesus is alive.
\v 12 So you can see that death is doing its work in us, but that life is working in you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 We who are alive are always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be shown in our body.
\v 12 So death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **We who are alive are always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus** - Carrying the death of Jesus represents being in danger of dying because of being loyal to Jesus.  AT: "For those of us who are alive, God is always leading us to face death because we are joined to  Jesus" or "People are always causing us who are alive to be in danger of dying because we are joined to Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so that the life of Jesus may be shown in our body** - God wants Jesus' life be shown in us. Possible meanings are 1) "our bodies will live again, because Jesus is alive" or 2) "the spiritual life that Jesus gives also may be shown in our bodies." See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2co:04:07|4:10]].
  * **so that the life of Jesus may be shown in our body** - This can be stated in active form. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2co:04:07|4:10]]. AT: "so other people may see the life of Jesus in our body" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **death is at work in us, but life is at work in you** - Paul speaks of death and life as if they are persons who can work. This means that they are always in danger of physical death so that the Corinthians can have spiritual life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
