====== 2 Corinthians 04:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 \add So, although\add* we are \add still\add* alive, we always realize that we may be killed \f + \ft Or:that \add people some day\add* may kill us \f* because \add we teach about\add* Jesus. \add God allows us to suffer\add* in order that \add people\add* will see that Jesus is alive and that he is \add strengthening\add* our bodies that are some day going to die.
\v 12 So \add I conclude that although\add* we \add apostles\add* are constantly \add suffering and may soon\add* die, \add the result of that is that all of\add* you \add have now received eternal\add* life.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Those of us who are alive, God is always leading us to face death because we are joined to Jesus, so that when people look at us, they can know that Jesus is alive.
\v 12 So you can see that death is doing its work in us, but that life is working in you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 We who are alive are always being handed over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be shown in our human bodies.
\v 12 For this reason, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.

  * **We who are alive** - Paul is referring to everyone who believes in and have preached Christ and have not yet been put to death.
  * **handed over to**  - "at risk of"
  * **the life of Jesus may be shown** - This phrase refers to the continued life of Jesus and what that means to the writer of Hebrews and all believers who risk death because of their faith in Jesus as Lord. AT: "our belief that Jesus raised himself from the dead and promised to also give us eternal life may be proved" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **our human bodies.**  - As in [[en:bible:notes:2co:04:07|4:10]] this phrase refers to how a person lives their life or the choices they make. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **death is at work in us**  - Paul refers to death as if it can work.  This is to say that people being threatened with death can have a positive effect in others.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **life is at work in you** - Paul refers to life as if it can work.  This is to say that the knowledge of eternal life is having a positive effect in the lives of the Jewish believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
