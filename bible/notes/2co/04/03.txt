====== 2 Corinthians 04:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 And if, \add as some of you say, some people are\add* not able to understand the message \add that we teach about Christ, it is not because we do not teach it clearly\add*. It is because those people \add do not want to believe it\add*. They are on the road to eternal death.
\v 4 \add Satan, who is\add* the one \add who rules\add* this world, controls the thoughts of those unbelievers. He prevents them from understanding the message about how wonderful Christ is. \add They are not able to understand that\add* Jesus is like God \add in every way\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If the good news is hidden with a veil, it is hidden from those who are dying apart from God.
\v 4 For them, the god of this world has made them blind to the truth because they do not trust the good news about the wonderful honor of Christ—for it is Christ who shows us what God is like.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing.
\v 4 In their case, the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds so they are not able to see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those** - The word "veiled" refers to being not understandable.  If something is veiled it cannot be seen.  Not being seen is used to refer to not being understood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **the god of this world**  - This phrase refers to Satan. English translations refer to a false god using a small “g” and write God with a large “G” when referring to the one true God. Other languages may also choose to do that. Another way to distinguish them would be to use two different terms for “God” and “god.”
    * **has blinded** - AT: "prevented understanding" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **the light**  - The word "light" refers to the truth.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
