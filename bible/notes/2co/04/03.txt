===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 And if, \add as some of you say, some people are\add* not able to understand the message \add that we teach about Christ, it is not because we do not teach it clearly\add*. It is because those people \add do not want to believe it\add*. They are on the road to eternal death.
\v 4 \add Satan, who is\add* the one \add who rules\add* this world, controls the thoughts of those unbelievers. He prevents them from understanding the message about how wonderful Christ is. \add They are not able to understand that\add* Jesus is like God \add in every way\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If the message of the good news is hidden from sight and not heard, if its glory is put under a veil, it is only veiled to those that God is not saving.
\v 4 For them, the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds so much that they cannot see or understand the good news of the glory of Christ, who shows us what God is like.

\v 3 But if our good news is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
\v 4 In their case, the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds so they are not able to see the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
