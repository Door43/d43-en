\v 3 For they gave according to their ability, I bear witness, even beyond what they were able. And of their own free will
\v 4 they were begging us with much urging for the favor of sharing in this ministry to the saints.
\v 5 And this was not as we had expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and then, by the will of God, to us.
