\v 3 \add I know that this is true\add*, because I have seen for myself that they not only gave \add money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* that they were able \add to give\add*, they gave \add so much money that they did\add* not even keep enough \add to buy what they needed for themselves\add*. Without anyone telling them \add to share their possessions\add*,
\v 4 they themselves kept requesting us to let them participate in what \add other believers\add* are doing in \add sending a gift of money to\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* God's people \add in Judea province\add*.
\v 5 I thought \add that they would give only a little of their money, but\add* they did much \add more than that\add*! First, they told the Lord \add Jesus\add* that they wanted to do \add what pleases him. After that, they told\add* me that they wanted to do \add whatever I thought was good for them to do, because they were sure that\add* would be what God \add wanted them to do\add*.

\v 3 They gave as much as they were able—and I testify it is true—and some sacrificed and gave so much they suffered need themselves, but they still gave. They wanted to give,
\v 4 and they begged us over and over and pleaded with us to allow them to give to this collection, so they could help those believers whom God has set apart for himself.
\v 5 We did not think they could give like that. But they first gave themselves to the Lord, and then they gave themselves to us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For they gave as much as they were able, I bear witness, and even beyond what they were able. And of their own free will
\v 4 with much begging they pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this ministry to the saints.
\v 5 And this happened not as we had expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and then, by the will of God, to us.
