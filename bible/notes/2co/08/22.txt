\v 22 And with them we send our brother, whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but now even more diligent because of the great confidence he has in you.
\v 23 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. Concerning our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
\v 24 So show them your love and why we boasted about you in the churches.
