\v 22 Furthermore, there is also another believer \add here\add* whom we are sending \add to you along with the two\add* men \add whom I have just mentioned\add*. Many times I have seen his good work \add for the Lord\add*, and I know that he is eager \add to serve the Lord\add*. Now, because he knows for sure that you \add want to give this gift the same as other believers do\add*, he is even more eager than he was before \add to go with the two other men\add*.
\v 23 As for Titus, \add I have chosen him because\add* he is my partner, and he has worked faithfully with me \add to help you\add*. As for the other two men, the congregations \add in this area\add* are sending them as their messengers. These two men honor Christ \add by everything they do\add*.
\v 24 So then, show them that you truly love \add others\add*, and \add in that way\add* help their congregations to understand \add why\add* we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are always saying such good things about you.

\v 22 And with these brothers we are sending to you, we are adding still one more brother. We have seen that this brother does important work in a very faithful manner. He now desires even more to help you because he trusts you very much.
\v 23 As for Titus himself, he is my partner; he works alongside me. The other brothersâ€”it is the churches in our region who have chosen them to go with us to Jerusalem. When other people see them, they will praise Christ very much because of them.
\v 24 So show these brothers how you love them; show them why we spoke so well about you, and why we could not stop telling all the churches how proud we are of you.

\v 22 And with them we send still another brother whom we have often tested and found enthusiastic in many tasks, but who is now even more diligent because of the great confidence he has in you.
\v 23 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. Concerning our brothers, they are sent by the churches, an honor to Christ.
\v 24 So show them your love, and show them why we boasted about you among the other churches.
