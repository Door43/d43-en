\v 13 I do not mean that \add you should give so much to help others that\add* you yourselves do not have what you need. No, what I want is that \add both you and others\add* will have what\add you need\add*.
\v 14 Right now, when you have more \add than you need\f + \ft Or: \add*plenty \f* and \add the believers in Judea\add* do not have enough\f + \ft Or: all that they need \f*, \add with your gift you will enable them to have enough. Maybe some day\add* when you do not have enough\f + \ft Or: all that you need \f* and they have more than they need, they will \add be able to\add* help you. Then everyone will have enough \f + \ft Or: In that way each will share alike \f*.
\v 15 \add If that happens, the result will be like it is written\add* \f + \ft Or:\add like someone, Or: Moses\add* wrote \f* \add in the Scriptures about the time when God provided manna for his people\add*,
\p If someone gathered a lot \add of manna\add*, he still did not have more than he needed, \add because he gave some to someone who did not have enough\add*. And those who gathered only a little \add manna\add* still had all that they needed \f + \ft litotes \f*, \add because others who gathered more than they needed gave some manna to them\add*.

\v 13 We are not taxing you because we do not want others to have to support themselves. But it is fair for you to help them.
\v 14 You have more than you need at this time; what you have left over will be enough for them, too. In the future, they will have more than they need, and perhaps then, they will be able to help you. That is fair for everyone.
\v 15 This is like the Scriptures say:
\q "The one who had much did not have anything left to share;
\q1 but the one who had only a little did not need anything more."

\v 13 For this task is not so others may be relieved and you may be burdened. But there should be fairness.
\v 14 Your abundance at the current time will supply what they need. This is also so that their abundance may also supply your need, and so that there may be fairness,
\v 15 as it is written, 
\q "The one with much did not have anything left over; 
\q1 but the one who had little did not have any lack."
