\v 20 \add The believers have\add* given money \f + \ft euphemism \f* generously. So, \add by sending that fellow believer along with Titus\add* to take the money \add to Jerusalem\add*, we are trying to make sure that no one will be able to accuse us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* of taking some of the money for ourselves\add*.
\v 21 \add I say that\add* because we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* want to make sure that the Lord \add God\add* will see that what we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* do is right, and other people will see it, too.
