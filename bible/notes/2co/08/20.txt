===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 \add The believers have\add* given money \f + \ft euphemism \f* generously. So, \add by sending that fellow believer along with Titus\add* to take the money \add to Jerusalem\add*, we are trying to make sure that no one will be able to accuse us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* of taking some of the money for ourselves\add*.
\v 21 \add I say that\add* because we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* want to make sure that the Lord \add God\add* will see that what we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* do is right, and other people will see it, too.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 We are doing everything we can to keep anyone from asking why we are asking for this money that you are giving so generously.
\v 21 We are careful to do all this in an honest and open way. We want everyone to know how we are doing this, and we know that the Lord sees us, too.
</usfm>
