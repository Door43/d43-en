\v 18 We have sent Titus along with another Christian brother. All the believers in the churches praise him because he preaches the good news very well.
\v 19 The believers in the churches asked him to go with us to Jerusalem to help us take to the believers there what you and the others are giving to them. We all want to contribute this money in order to honor the Lord and to show everyone how much we believers help each other.
