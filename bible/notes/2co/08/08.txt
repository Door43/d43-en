\v 9 You already know \add how much\add* our Lord Jesus \add did for you\add* that you did not deserve. Everything \add in heaven\add* belonged to him. But in order to benefit you, \add he left all of those things behind and became a human being. Here on earth he had\add* very few possessions \add of his own\add*. But because he became poor like that, he is \add able to cause\add* you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* to become \add spiritually\add* rich.

\v 8 I am not giving you an order, but I want you to prove how much you love the Lord by comparing how you give to how others give to people in need.
\v 9 I say this, because you know how kind Jesus Christ has been to you. Although he possessed everything, he gave it all up and became poor. He did this in order to make you rich.

\v 8 I say this not as a command, but to prove the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the diligence of other people.
\v 9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that even though he was rich, for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich.
