\v 10 So, \add as you think of our Lord's example, I will tell you\add* what I think that you should do in this matter \add of giving money. As you know\add*, last year, because you desired \add to give money to help God's people in Judea province\add*, you began \add collecting money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*.
\v 11 So now you should finish \add collecting\add* the money \f + \ft euphemism \f* that you began \add to gather\add*. In that way, \add everyone will know that you are just\add* as ready to finish \add collecting this gift\add* as you were to begin collecting it. Give what you are able to give.
\v 12 \add Keep in mind that\add* if you really want to \add give something to help others\add*, whatever any one of you is \add able to give\add* will be pleasing \add to God. God does not expect his people to give more\add* than they can afford to give.

\v 10 And in this I have some encouragement to give you: you started this ministry of help a year ago, and when you began it you were eager to do it.
\v 11 In the same way, you should finish this work. Just as you were eager to begin this work, you should be eager to end it, and to do this as quickly as you can.
\v 12 God will accept what you do in this task, if you are eager to do it. You must finish the work by giving money from the money that you have. You cannot give what you do not have.

<usfm>
\v 10 In this matter I will give you advice about what will help you: one year ago, you not only started to do something, but you desired to do it.
\v 11 Now finish doing it. So just as there was an eagerness and desire to do it then, you also may bring it to completion, as you are able.
\v 12 For if an eagerness to do this work exists, it is a good and acceptable thing, based on what a person has, not on what he does not have.
