\v 6 Titus had already begun encouraging you to contribute money, so we urged him to guide the collection to its end.
\v 7 As you do better than others, not only in your trust in God, in your encouraging words, in what you have learned, in taking a task to completion, and in your love for us—make sure you do very well by completing this collection also.
