===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you?** - Paul is asking a rhetorical question, AT: "It is wrong for you to think that all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you." Some translate this as a statement. AT: "You have been thinking all this time that we have been defending ourselves to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **In the sight of God** - Paul speaks of God knowing everything Paul does as if God were physically present and observed everything Paul said and did. AT: "Before God" or "With God as witness" or "In the presence of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for your strengthening** - "to strengthen you." Paul speaks of knowing how to obey God and desiring to obey him as if it were physical growth. AT: "so that you would know God and obey him better" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
