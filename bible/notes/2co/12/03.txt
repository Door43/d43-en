\v 3 And I know such a man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—
\v 4 was caught up into Paradise, and heard words so sacred, people are not permitted to speak.
\v 5 On behalf of such a person I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.
