<usfm>
\v 3-4 But he was \add suddenly\add* taken \f + \ft Or:\add Christ suddenly\add* took him \f* up to \add a place called\add* Paradise, \add that wonderful place where God lives. I repeat that\add* I do not know whether his body \add went there\add* or only his spirit. Only God knows \add that. While he was there, God\add* told him some things that he does not allow \add human beings\add* to tell \add others about\add*.
\v 5 I will proudly talk about that man. However, I will not be boasting \add as\add* I say that I \add am the one who saw and heard those wonderful things\add*. I will talk only about the things that \add cause others to think of\add* me as a weak \add human being like everyone else\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3  And I—whether in my body or only in my spirit, God alone knows—
\v 4 I was taken up into a place in heaven called paradise. There I heard things that were much too holy for me to be able to tell you.
\v 5 I can boast about that—but God made all that happen, not I. For myself, I can be proud only about how God works in me, a weak man.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 And I know such a man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—
\v 4 who was caught up into paradise and who heard things too sacred for anyone to say.
\v 5 On behalf of such a person I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.
