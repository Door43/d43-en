\v 20 \add I have written this way to you\add* because I worry that when I come \add to visit you\add*, I will see that \add some of\add* you are \add not conducting your lives the way\add* that I want you \add to\add*. If that is so, \add when I get there\add* you will see that I will have \add to act\add* in a \add very severe way toward you, and I am sure\add* that you do not want that. Specifically, I am afraid that \add some of you\add* may be quarreling, or that you are being jealous \add of each other\add*, or that you quickly \add show others that you are\add* very angry \add with them\add*, or that you are acting selfishly, or that \add some of\add* you are saying bad things about others, or that you are spreading false rumors\f + \ft Or: saying false things \f* about each other, or that you are acting proudly, or that you are \add doing things\add* in a disorderly manner.
\v 21 \add I\add* \add feel anxious\f + \ft Or: am concerned\add* \f* \add about you. I worry that\add* when I visit you again, God, the one whom I \add serve\add*, will make me feel ashamed of you \add when I see that\add* you \add still are not conducting your lives as believers should\add*. Then I will feel very sad about \add some of\add* you who were sinning previously and have not turned from your sinful behavior. \add Some of you\add* may still have impure \add thoughts. Some of you\add* may be having sexual intercourse with those to whom you are not married. \add And some of you\add* may be doing other shameful things.

\v 20 But when I come to you, I may not find you as I wished.  When I come you may not want to listen to me. I fear that you are arguing a lot among yourselves, that some of you are jealous of one another, and that some of you become very angry with each other. I fear that some of you are putting yourselves first, that you are talking about each other, and that some of you are very selfish.
\v 21 When I come to you, I am afraid when I see you, God will humble me. I am sad and I mourn for many of who disobeyed God and have not stopped sinning in various sexual ways.

\v 20 For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I wish, and that you might not find me as you wish—that there may be arguments, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, gossip, pride, and disorder.
\v 21 I am afraid that when I come back, my God might humble me before you, and I might mourn for many of them that have sinned before now, and did not repent from the impurity and sexual immorality and lustful indulgence which they practiced.
