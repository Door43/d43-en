====== 2 Corinthians 12:8-10 ======

<usfm>
\v 8 Three times I prayed to the Lord about it, begging him to take this away from me.
\v 9 But he said to me, "\add No, I will not take this away from you. Instead\add*, I will kindly help you, and that will be all that you need, because it is \add when you are\add* weak that I \add can\add* best \add work\add* powerfully \add to help you\add*." So, because of \add what the Lord said to me\add*, I will very gladly boast about \add the things that make\add* me \add seem\add* weak, so that \add people may realize\add* that it is Christ who gives me power \add to serve him\add*.
\v 10 For that reason, \add whenever I am\add* weak, or \add when people\add* insult me, \add or when I have to endure\add* hardships, or \add when I am persecuted\add* \f + \ft Or:\add people\add* cause me to suffer \f* or \add when I am in situations that\add* distress me, I am content because \add I am serving\add* Christ. \add I can say that\add* because at any time when I myself am weak, that is the \add very\add* time when \add Christ\add* powerfully \add helps me\add*.

\v 8 I prayed three times to the Lord about this matter; each time I begged him to take this away from me.
\v 9 But he said to me, "No, I will not take this away from you. All you need is for me to love you and be with you, because I do my most powerful work in you when you are weak." That is why I would rather be proud of my weakness, so that Christ's power can come and make me strong.
\v 10 I can face anything because Christ is with me. It may be that I must be weak, or that others might treat me with scorn, or that I must have great hardships, or that others will try to kill me. It may be that I will continue to suffer hardships of various kinds. In any case, when my power is gone, then I am at my strongest.

\v 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, for him to take it away from me.
\v 9 And he said to me, "My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of Christ might reside on me.
\v 10 Therefore I am content for Christ's sake in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Three times** - Paul put these words at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize that he had prayed many times about his "thorn" ([[:en:bible:notes:2co:12:06|12:7]]).
  * **Lord about this** - "Lord about this thorn in the flesh," or "Lord about this affliction"
  * **My grace is enough for you** - "I will be kind to you, and that is all you need"
  * **for power is made perfect in weakness** - "for my power works best when you are weak"
  * **the power of Christ might reside on me** - Paul speaks of Christ's power as if it were a tent built over him. Possible meanings are 1) "people might see that I have the power of Christ" or 2) "I might truly have the power of Christ." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am content for Christ's sake in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations** - Possible meanings are 1) "I am content in weakness, insults, troubles, persecutions, and distressing situations if these things come because I belong to Christ" or 2) "I am content in weakness ... if these things cause more people to know Christ."
  * **in weaknesses** - "when I am weak"
  * **in insults** - "when people try to make me angry by saying that I am a bad person"
  * **in troubles** - "when I am suffering"
  * **distressing situations** - "when there is trouble"
  * **For whenever I am weak, then I am strong** - Paul is saying that when he is no longer strong enough to do what needs to be done, Christ, who is more powerful than Paul could ever be, will work through Paul to do what needs to be done. However, it would be best to translate these words literally, if your language allows.
