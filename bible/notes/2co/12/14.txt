\v 14 Now listen to me! It is time for me to come to you for a third \add visit. When I come\add*, I \add still\add* will not insist that you \add pay me for my work\add*, because I do not want \add any of\add* your \add money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*! What I want is for you \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to love and appreciate me\add*. It is not \add normally the duty of\add* children to save \add money to provide for the needs of\add* their parents. Instead, it \add is the duty of\add* parents to \add provide\add* for their children \f + \ft metaphor \f*. In the same way, \add it is not your duty to provide for me. Instead, it is my duty to provide spiritual help for you because you are my spiritual children\add*.
\v 15 So, on my part, \add as a good parent would do\add*, I will be very happy to use everything that I have, and do everything that I possibly can, \add in order to help you\add*. And because I love you very much, I will be very disappointed if \add you\add* do not love me a little bit, too.\f + \ft Or: will \add you\add* not love me a little bit, too? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 14 So listen to this! I am now ready to visit you for a third time, and on this trip, as on all the others, I will not ask you for any money. I do not want anything you have. What I want is you! You know the principle that we all follow in our families: The children should not pay the expenses of their parents, but the parents save up to pay the expenses of the children.
\v 15 I will most happily do everything I can for you, even if it means losing my life. If this means that I love you more than ever, surely you should love me more than ever as well.

\v 14 Look! I am ready to come to you a third time. I will not be a burden to you, for I do not want what is yours. I want you. For children should not save up for the parents. Instead, the parents should save up for the children.
\v 15 I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I want you** - The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "What I want is that you love and accept me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **children should not save up for the parents** - Young children are not responsible for saving money or other goods to give to their healthy parents.
  * **I will most gladly spend and be spent** - Paul speaks of his work and his physical life as if it were money that he or God could spend. AT: "I will gladly do any work and gladly allow God to permit people to kill me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for your souls** - The word "souls" is a metonym for the people themselves. AT: "for you" or "so you will live well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **If I love you more, am I to be loved less?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "If I love you so much, you should not love me so little." or "If ... much, you should love me more than you do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **more** - It is not clear what it is that Paul's love is "more" than. It is probably best to use "very much" or a "so much" that can be compared to "so little" later in the sentence.
