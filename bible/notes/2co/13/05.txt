\v 5 Each of you must examine how he lives; you must look for evidence that you trust in how God loves you and has mercy on you. You must put yourself to this test: Do you see that Jesus Christ lives within you? He lives in every one of you, unless, of course, you fail this test.
\v 6 And I hope that you will find that Christ lives in us, too.
