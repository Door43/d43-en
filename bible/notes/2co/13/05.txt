\v 5 Each of you should ask yourself: "\add Do I\add* believe \add God's message about Christ?\add*" Each of you should \add test yourselves to\add* make sure that you truly do \add believe\add* in Christ \add and thus truly belong to him\add*, and that\add his Spirit lives\add* within you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add*. When you test yourselves \add in that way\add*, I am sure that you will \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* say \add to me\add*, "Yes, of course we \add belong to\add* Christ."
\v 6 I am \add also\add* certain that you will know that I \add belong to Christ, just like you do\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 It is yourselves whom you must examine and see how you live. You must look for evidence that you trust in how God loves you and has mercy on you. It is you whom you must put yourself to the test and ask if Jesus Christ lives within you? He lives in every one of you, unless, of course, you fail this test.
\v 6 And I hope that you will find that we pass the test and Christ lives in us.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not realize this about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless you have failed the test.
\v 6 And I trust that you will recognize that we have not failed the test.
