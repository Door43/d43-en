====== 2 Corinthians 13:9-10 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 I am happy \add whenever\add* you are strongly \add trusting and obeying Christ, and because of that I do not have to use my authority to discipline you. It does not matter to me if that makes people think that I do not have any authority\add*. Truly, what I am praying for is that \add God\add* will \add help\add* you to completely change your conduct.
\v 10 That is why I am writing these things while I am still away from you. \add What I want is that\add* when I visit you, \add you will already be conducting your lives as God wants you to\add*, and so I will not have to \add discipline you\add* severely, as the \add Lord Jesus Christ gave me\add* the authority to do. The authority that I have from the Lord is to help you to become \add spiritually\add* mature believers, not to cause you to stop \add trusting in him\add*.

<usfm>
\v 9 We have joy when we are weak and you are strong. We pray that you may always trust and obey God completely.
\v 10 I am away from you now as I write this to you. When I come to you, I do not have to deal harshly with you. Because the Lord made me an apostle, I prefer to encourage you and not to make you weaker.

<usfm>
\v 9 For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. We also pray that you may be made complete.
\v 10 I write these things while I am away from you, so that when I am with you I do not have to act harshly toward you, using the authority the Lord gave me to build you up and not tear you down.
