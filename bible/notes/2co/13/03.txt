\v 3 Because you have demanded that I prove to you that Christ is speaking \add to you when\add* I \add speak to you, I will show you that I speak to you as his apostle. Christ\add* does not approve of your sinful behavior. On the contrary, he will powerfully \add discipline you\add*.
\v 4 \add It is true that\add* Christ \add seemed to be\add* weak when he was crucified \f + \ft Or:when \add people\add* killed him by nailing him to the cross \f*. But \add it is also true that\add* he \add now\add* lives because God \add worked\add* powerfully \add to make him alive again. Similarly\add*, as I \add serve\add* God, I also am a weak human \add being as Christ was\add*. But I am also \add have a close relationship with\add* Christ \add who is now alive again\add*. And with his \add authority\add* I will use God's power \add to discipline\add* you.

\v 3 I tell you this because you are looking for proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you; instead, he is working in you by his great power.
\v 4 We learn from Christ's example, because they crucified him when he was weak, yet God has made him alive again. And we, too, are weak as we live and follow his example, but with him, God will strengthen us as we talk with you about these sins that some of you have committed.

\v 3 I tell you this because you are seeking evidence  that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak toward you; instead, he is powerful in you.
\v 4 For he was crucified in weakness, but he is alive by God's power. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him by the power of God among you.
