===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 \add In the Scriptures it is stated that when one person\add* accuses \add another of wrongdoing, you must not believe his\add* accusation \add right away\add*. \add First, you must listen to at least\add* two or three people who actually saw what happened. \add So keep in mind that\add* this will be the third time that I will visit you!
\v 2 When I visited you the second time, I warned you \add that I was going to punish all the wrongdoers among you\add*. \add And now\add* I am \add warning you\add* again while I am still away \add from you\add*. When I visit you this third time, I will punish those who were sinning \add at the time when I visited you\add* before \add and who are still sinning\add*, and I will \add punish\add* the others \add who have been sinning since then, if they have not turned away from their sinful behavior\add*.

\v 1 This is the third time I am coming to you to deal with these matters. The principle in dealing with these issues is that every accusation against another must be based on the testimony of two or three persons, not just one.
\v 2 When I was there on the second visit I said to those who had sinned and who being charged before the church, and to the entire church, and I will say it again: I will not overlook these charges.

\v 1 This is the third time that I am coming to you.  "Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
\v 2 I have already said to those who sinned before and to all the rest when I was there the second time, and I say it again: If I come again, I will not spare them.
