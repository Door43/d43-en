====== 2 Corinthians 13:7-8 ======

<usfm>
\v 7 But \add because I do not want to have to punish you\add*, I am praying to God that he will help you not to do anything evil \add that would cause me to have to punish you. I pray this\add*, not in order that when people \add who say that I am not your apostle\add* realize \add that my ministry among you has been very successful, they will have to agree\add* that I do have authority from Christ. Instead, \add I pray this because I want\add* you to do what is right, even though that might mean that \add my opponents would think\add* that I do not have authority from Christ, \add since I would not have an opportunity to show my authority to discipline you\add*.
\v 8 \add If you do what is right, I will not discipline you\add*, \add because it would\add* not\add be right for me to do that if you are conducting your lives the way you should, like\add* God's true \add message says that you should. What God asks me to do is to help people to know and obey his\add* true \add message\add*.

\v 7 Now we pray to God that you may not do anything that is wrong. We pray for this, not because we want to seem better than you by passing that test. Instead, we want you to know and do the right things. Even if we seem to have failed, we want you to succeed.
\v 8 The truth controls what we do; we cannot do anything against the truth.

<usfm>
\v 7 Now we pray to God that you may not do wrong, not so we may appear to have passed the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed the test.
\v 8 For we are not able to do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
