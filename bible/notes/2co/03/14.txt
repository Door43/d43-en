\v 14 But their minds were hardened. Even until this very day when they read the old covenant, the same veil remains, because only in Christ is the it taken away.
\v 15 But even today, whenever Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.
\v 16 But when a person turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
