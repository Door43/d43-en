\v 14 But the Israelites stubbornly refused to \add understand that the old agreement would end\add*. Even now, when they read the old agreement, \add they still do not realize that it has ended. It is as if\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* that same veil \add that Moses put on his face\add* is now over their \add minds, keeping them from understanding God's true message\add*. They will \add understand that message\add* only when \add they come to trust\add* in Christ. Then \add it will be as though God\add* has removed the veil.
\v 15 \add Throughout all these years\add*, even until now, when \add the Israelites\add* read what Moses \add write, it is as though\add* a veil is covering their minds.
\v 16 But when any of them believes in the Lord \add Jesus\add*, \add God\add* removes that veil from them.

\v 14 The children of Israel in our day were unwilling even to hear the more glorious message. Even today when the old covenant law is read, the same veil that Moses wore, remains. They cannot see that glory, or the eternal glory, because only in Christ is the veil taken away and only then they can hear the message and  see his glory that never fades.
\v 15 But even today, whenever the law of Moses is read, a veil remains over their hearts, and their understanding in covered.
\v 16 But when a person turns to the Lord, the veil is removed and they will see the glory of God.
