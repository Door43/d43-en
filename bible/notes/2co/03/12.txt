\v 12 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* know that the message that we teach is a \add much more wonderful message than the message that Moses taught\add*. So we \add can preach\add* boldly.
\v 13 We do not \add need to put a veil over our faces when we teach people\add*, as Moses did. Moses put a veil over his face so that the Israelites would not see that the radiance \add on his face\add* soon faded away. \add Similarly, the glory of the old agreement has also faded away\add*.

\v 12 Since we have such confidence, we are very bold,
