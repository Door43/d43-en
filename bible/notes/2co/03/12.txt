\v 12 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* know that the message that we teach is a \add much more wonderful message than the message that Moses taught\add*. So we \add can preach\add* boldly.
\v 13 We do not \add need to put a veil over our faces when we teach people\add*, as Moses did. Moses put a veil over his face so that the Israelites would not see that the radiance \add on his face\add* soon faded away. \add Similarly, the glory of the old agreement has also faded away\add*.

\v 12 Since we have such hope for an eternal glory, we are able to be very bold in what we attempt and in how we live for God.
\v 13 We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so the children of Israel would not have to look at the glory that was shining from Moses' face. They were looking at the diminishing glory that was fading away.
