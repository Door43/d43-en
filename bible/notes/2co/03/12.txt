\v 12 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* know that the message that we teach is a \add much more wonderful message than the message that Moses taught\add*. So we \add can preach\add* boldly.
\v 13 We do not \add need to put a veil over our faces when we teach people\add*, as Moses did. Moses put a veil over his face so that the Israelites would not see that the radiance \add on his face\add* soon faded away. \add Similarly, the glory of the old agreement has also faded away\add*.

\v 12 Since we apostles trust in God for the future, we have great courage.
\v 13 We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so the children of Israel would not have to look at the fading light from God.

\v 12 Since we have such confidence, we are very bold,
