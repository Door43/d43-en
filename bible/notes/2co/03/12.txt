===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* know that the message that we teach is a \add much more wonderful message than the message that Moses taught\add*. So we \add can preach\add* boldly.
\v 13 We do not \add need to put a veil over our faces when we teach people\add*, as Moses did. Moses put a veil over his face so that the Israelites would not see that the radiance \add on his face\add* soon faded away. \add Similarly, the glory of the old agreement has also faded away\add*.

\v 12 Since we apostles trust in God for the future, we have great courage.
\v 13 We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so the children of Israel would not have to look at the fading light from God.

\v 12 Since we have such a hope, we are very bold.
\v 13 We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face, so that the people of Israel were not able to look directly at the ending of a glory that was passing away.
