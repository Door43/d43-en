====== 2 Corinthians 03:4-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I \add can very\add* confidently \add write these things about the work that Silas, Timothy, and I did among you, because God knows that what I write is true. We\f + \ft exclusive \f* are true workers\add* for God\add because of what\add* Christ \add has done for us\add*.
\v 5 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, by ourselves, do not have the ability \add to do this work\add*. None of us \add apostles\add* can say, "\add I have changed the lives of these people\add*." God is the one \add who has given us this ability\add*.
\v 6 He is the one who enables us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* to be his messengers. \add He has enabled us to tell people the message\add* about the new agreement \add that he is making with them\add*. This is not a \add message about obeying all the\add* written laws \add of his old agreement that he made with the Jewish people\add*. Instead, \add it is a message about God giving us his\add* Spirit. \add Previously, God condemned people to be\add* separated from him forever \add if they did not obey his laws\add*. But by \add God's new agreement\add* his Spirit enables people to live \add eternally\add*.

\v 4 This is how we trust God, because we are joined to Christ.
\v 5 We are not able to do anything for God in our own strength, so we cannot claim to be able to. Instead, it is God who gives us all we need to serve him.
\v 6 God gave us what we needed to be servants of the new covenant. This covenant does not get its strength from anything that is written, from the Spirit of God, who makes us to live joined to Christ. Written commands do nothing but bring make people die.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 And this is the confidence that we have in God  through Christ.
\v 5 Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our adequacy is from God,
\v 6 who also qualified us to be servants of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Paul and Timothy continue their letter to the people of the church in Corinth.

    * **this is the confidence** - The word "this" refers to Paul and Timothy's awareness of how the knowledge of Christ has changed the lives of the people of the church in Corinth.
    * **competent in ourselves**  - "qualified in ourselves"
    * **our adequacy**  - "our qualification"
    * **not of the letter but of the Spirit**  - Paul uses the word "letter" to refer to the Old Testament laws because words are made up of letters.  The phrase "letter of the law" means every part of the Old Testament laws. AT: "not by obeying the law but as a gift of the Holy Spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **letter kills**  - This phrase means trying to perfectly obey the Old Testament law and failing will lead to spiritual death. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
