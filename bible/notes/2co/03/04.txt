====== 2 Corinthians 03:4-6 ======

<usfm>
\v 4 I \add can very\add* confidently \add write these things about the work that Silas, Timothy, and I did among you, because God knows that what I write is true. We\f + \ft exclusive \f* are true workers\add* for God\add because of what\add* Christ \add has done for us\add*.
\v 5 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, by ourselves, do not have the ability \add to do this work\add*. None of us \add apostles\add* can say, "\add I have changed the lives of these people\add*." God is the one \add who has given us this ability\add*.
\v 6 He is the one who enables us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* to be his messengers. \add He has enabled us to tell people the message\add* about the new agreement \add that he is making with them\add*. This is not a \add message about obeying all the\add* written laws \add of his old agreement that he made with the Jewish people\add*. Instead, \add it is a message about God giving us his\add* Spirit. \add Previously, God condemned people to be\add* separated from him forever \add if they did not obey his laws\add*. But by \add God's new agreement\add* his Spirit enables people to live \add eternally\add*.

\v 4 This is how we trust God, because we are joined to Christ.
\v 5 We are not able to do anything for God in our own strength, so we cannot claim to be able to. Instead, it is God who gives us all we need to serve him.
\v 6 God gave us what we needed to be servants of the new covenant. This covenant does not get its strength from anything that is written, but from the Spirit of God, who makes us to live joined to Christ. Written commands do nothing but bring make people die.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 And this is the confidence that we have in God through Christ.
\v 5 We are not competent in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us. Instead, our competence is from God.
\v 6 It is God who made us able to be servants of a new covenant. This is a covenant not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this is the confidence** - Paul's confidence is knowing his adequacy is from God.
  * **competent in ourselves** - "qualified in ourselves" or "adequate in ourselves"
  * **our competence** - "our qualification" or "our sufficiency"
  * **not of the letter but of the Spirit** - Paul uses the word "letter," referring to the Old Testament laws where letters make up words. The phrase "letter of the law" means every Old Testament law. AT: "not by obeying the law but receiving as a gift of the Holy Spirit." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the letter kills** - This phrase means trying to perfectly obey the Old Testament law, where failing will lead to spiritual death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
