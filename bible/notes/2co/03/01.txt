\v 1 As I write these things about myself, I am not doing it to boast about how good I am, as some of you say I do. Some people always carry letters with them that tell how well they work, that other people have written. But I do not  need to bring letters like that when I come to you. Nor do I need to ask you to write letters like that for me when I go to other congregations.
\v 2 You yourselves are  like a letter that recommends my work for God to everyone. People see how Christ changed your lives when you believed the message that I taught you. Everyone who knows you can see the result of my work for God.
\v 3 You are like a letter that Christ himself has written that says good things about my work for God in your lives. You show people by the way you now conduct your lives that God has changed your lives as a result of my work among you. People did not find out about you by reading a letter that was written to them on paper with pen and ink. Instead, they saw how the Spirit of the all-powerful God has changed your lives. Nor did people find out about you by reading a letter that was carved on stone slabs like the stone slabs that God gave to Moses. Instead, it was the change that God's Spirit made in your lives that they saw.

\v 1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again ? Surely we do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, as some do?
\v 2 You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, known and read by all people.
\v 3 And you demonstrated that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.
