\v 1 \add As I write these things about myself\add*, I am \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* not \add doing it\add* to boast about how good I am, \add as some of you say I do\add*. Some people always carry letters with them that tell how well they work, \add that other people\add* have \add written\add*. But I do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* need \add to bring\add* letters like that \add when I come to you\add*. Nor do I need to ask you \add to write\add* letters like that \add for me when I go to other congregations\add*.
\v 2 You yourselves are \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like a\add* letter that recommends my work \add for God to everyone\add*. People see \add how Christ changed\add* your \add lives when you believed the message that I taught you\add*. Everyone \add who knows you\add* can see \add the result of my work for God\add*.
\v 3 You are \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like\add* a letter that Christ himself \add has written\add* that says good things about \add my work for God in your lives\add*. You show \add people by the way you now conduct your lives that God has changed your lives\add* as a result of my work \add among you. People did\add* not \add find out about you by\add* reading \add a letter that was written to them on paper\add* with \add pen and\add* ink. Instead, \add they saw how\add* the Spirit of the all-powerful God \add has changed your lives\add*. Nor \add did people find out about you by reading\add* a letter that was carved on stone slabs \add like the stone slabs that God gave to Moses\add*. Instead, \add it was the change that God's Spirit made in\add* your lives \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that they saw\add*.

\v 1 You know us well, and you should trust us. A stranger might need someone you know to write you a letter to introduce him to you, but you know us very well.
\v 2 You yourselves are like a letter that introduces us to other people, because everyone who knows you can see how much you trust us.
\v 3 The way you live is like a letter that Christ himself has written and that we brought to you. Of course, it is not a letter written with ink on stone tablets. No, it is a letter that the Spirit of the true God has written on your own hearts.

\p
\v 1 Are we beginning to praise ourselves again? We do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, like some people, do we?
\v 2 You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, known and read by all people.
\v 3 And you show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Are we beginning to praise ourselves again?**   - Paul says this to express they are not trying to make themselves seem better than they are. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **We do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, like some people, do we?** - Paul says this to express that the Corinthians already know about Paul and Timothy's good reputation. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **letter of recommendation**  - Paul and Timothy's love for the people of the church in Corinth is compared to a letter of recommendation that shows church Paul and Timothy can be trusted. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written..by the Spirit of the living God...on tablets of human hearts** - Paul is saying the people of the church in Corinth are like a letter that tells about their example and how the message about Christ, which Paul and Timothy shared with them, had power through the Holy Spirit, to change the kind of people they are. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts** - The word "stone" refers to something that does not change.  The phrase "human hearts" is used because they are soft and to refer to a person's ability to change. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **tablets**  - These are flat pieces of stone or clay that were used for writing.
