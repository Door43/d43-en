<usfm>
\v 7 \add Moses\add* taught \add the people that if they did not obey God's laws completely they would be\add* separated from God forever. God wrote \add his laws\add* on stone slabs. \add Then he gave them to Moses to teach them to the people. Although God's laws condemned\add* the people to die, \add when Moses brought those laws down from Sinai\add* Mountain\add , God caused Moses' face to shine\add* with radiance \add to show the people that these laws were God's laws\add*. The radiance was \add so bright that\add* the people of Israel could not keep looking at Moses' face. \add They had to look away\add*. But although the radiance \add was bright, it\add* was slowly fading away.
\v 8 \add So\add*, \add since God showed in such a wonderful way that those laws that condemned them to die were from him\add*, surely when we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* teach \add people about how God's\add* Spirit will \add change their lives\add*, \add God will show\add* in an even more wonderful way \add that\add* it is \add his message.\f + \ft Or: will not God show\add* in an even more wonderful way \add that\add* it is \add his message\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 7 God's Law that makes people die, that he had written on stone tablets, came to Moses with the brilliant light that always shines where God is. Moses' face shone bright with that light, so much so that the Israelites could not look at his face. However, that bright light slowly faded from his face.
\v 8 So what the Spirit does must have an even  brighter light.

\v 7 Now if the service of death that was engraved in letters on stones came in such glory that the people of Israel could not look directly at Moses' face, because of the glory of his face, a glory that was fading,
\v 8 will not the service of the Spirit be even more glorious?

===== Translation Notes: =====


     * **Now if...will not the service of the Spirit be even more glorious?**  - Paul uses this question to explain why the answer is easy to understand. AT: "Since...the service of the Spirit will be even more glorious." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
     * **engraved in letters** - "carved in letters"
    * **service of death...service of the Spirit**  - Paul uses the phrase "service of" to refer to the way God provided for us to get either spiritual death by the law, or eternal life by the Spirit. AT: "the way provided to get death...the way provided to get the Spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
