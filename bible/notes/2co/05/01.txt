\v 1 We know that these bodies we live in this world are temporary dwelling places, like tents that don't last very long. But we know that when we die, God gives us a permanent home in which we will live, a house that is never-ending in the place where God lives.
\v 2 While we live in the bodies we now have, we groan with longing for the heavenly bodies that will be our dwelling forever,
\v 3 because when God clothes us in our new bodies, we will be properly covered, with no shame,  and we will live forever in eternity.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 We know that if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by human hands, but an eternal house, in the heavens.
\v 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling—
\v 3 because by putting it on we may not be found naked.
