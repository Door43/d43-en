\v 1 We know that these bodies are only temporary dwelling places, like tents that don't last very long. But we know that when we die, God gives us a permanent place in which we will live, a body that lasts forever, a body that God has made.
\v 2 While we live in our physical bodies, we groan with longing for the bodies will have when we will live with God—
\v 3 because when God clothes us in our new bodies, that will be our covering, like clothing.

\p
\v 1 We know that if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by human hands, but an eternal house, in heaven.
\v 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling—
\v 3 because by putting it on we will not be found naked.
