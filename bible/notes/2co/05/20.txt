\v 20 So, it is I and my companions who are Christ's representatives \add in this world. When we tell people the message about Christ\add*, it is God himself who is pleading with them by means of what we \add say\add*. So, as true representatives of Christ, we plead with you: \add Believe God's true message about Christ in order that you may\add* be reconciled to \f + \ft Or:have a peaceful relationship with \f* him.
\v 21 \add You must believe that even though\add* Jesus never sinned, God \add punished him for all the\add* sinful things \add that people do, just\add* as \add if Jesus had done those sinful things himself\add*. And because of our close relationship with Christ, God has erased the record of our sins\f + \ft Or: declared \f* us no longer guilty for our sins.

\v 20 So God has appointed us to represent Christ. God pleads with you through us. And we plead with you on Christ's behalf: By Christ, let him make peace with you and bring you to himself.
\v 21 God made Christ the offering for sin—the one who never sinned—so that when we trust in Christ and believe in him, God makes us right with himself.

\v 20 So we are appointed as representatives of Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us. We plead with you, for the sake of Christ: "Be reconciled to God!"
\v 21 He made Christ become the sacrifice for our sin—the one who never sinned—so that in Christ we might become the righteousness of God.
