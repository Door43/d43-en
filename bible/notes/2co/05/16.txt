<usfm>
\v 16 So, \add because I realize how much Christ loves all people\add*, I no longer think about people in the way that those who do not believe \add in Christ\add* think about \add them\add*. Before I \add was a believer\add*, I thought about Christ in the way that other non-believers did. But I do not think of him that way anymore.
\v 17 The fact is that God makes every one \add of us\add* who \add trusts\add* in Christ to be completely different \add than we were before\add*. Our old \add way of conducting our lives\add* is gone. We now have a \add completely\add* new way of \add conducting our lives\add*.

\v 16 Since we live no longer for ourselves, we judge no one according to the way the world determines value or goodness. We once even viewed Christ by these worldly standards. But as Christians, now we judge no one by those worldly standards.
\v 17 When anyone knows Christ so that you live your life in him, you become a new person. Everything from the past is gone—God takes it all away— and then God makes everything in you new.

\v 16 For this reason, from now on we do not judge anyone according to worldly standards, even though we once regarded Christ in this way, but now we do not judge anyone in this way any longer.
\v 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature. The old things have passed away, behold, it has all become new.
