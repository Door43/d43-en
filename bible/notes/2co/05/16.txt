\v 16 So, \add because I realize how much Christ loves all people\add*, I no longer think about people in the way that those who do not believe \add in Christ\add* think about \add them\add*. Before I \add was a believer\add*, I thought about Christ in the way that other non-believers did. But I do not think of him that way anymore.
\v 17 The fact is that God makes every one \add of us\add* who \add trusts\add* in Christ to be completely different \add than we were before\add*. Our old \add way of conducting our lives\add* is gone. We now have a \add completely\add* new way of \add conducting our lives\add*.

\v 16 For this reason, from now  on,  we do not perceive any man according to human standards, even though we once knew Christ as a human being, but now we do not know him in that way.
\v 17 Therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature. The old things have passed away, behold, it has all become new.
