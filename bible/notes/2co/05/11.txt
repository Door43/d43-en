\v 11 It makes me fearful \add to think that some day I will stand before the Lord for him to judge me\add*. So I \add do everything that I can to\add* convince people \add that they should believe\add* \f + \ft Or: \add that I teach\add* sincerely \f* \add God's message\add*. God knows very well \add how I conduct my life and what I teach\add*, and I really believe that you also know it, within yourselves.
\v 12 Once again \add I say, as I write this\add*, I am not just \add trying to\add* make you think well\f + \ft Or: highly \f* of me, \add as some people will probably say that I am\add*. Instead, I am \add telling you in this letter why you have\add* good reason \add to tell those who criticize me\add* that you think highly of me. \add I am telling you this\add* so that you will know what to say to those \add teachers of false doctrine among you\add*. They are proud \add of what they have done\add*, instead of \add making sure that\add* their hearts\add are right with God and being pleased with that\add*.

\v 11 Therefore we know the awesome nature of the Lord that causes us to tremble before him. We do all we can to appeal to people to consider the coming day of Christ's judgment of all our lives and the fact that God sees everything we do. Our appeal is supported by the kind of people we are. You saw how we live to please God and our appeal is supported by our faith in Christ that you saw with your own eyes.
\v 12 We are not seeking your praise. We only want you to know what kind of people we are, so that you can tell the difference between people that live for the show and the appearance in order to impress people, and those who live the way they do because of what fills their hearts.

\v 11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade people. What we are is clearly seen by God, and I expect we are also well known to your consciences.
\v 12 We do not commend ourselves to you again, but we are giving you a reason to boast about us, so you may have an answer for those who boast about appearance but not about what is in heart.
