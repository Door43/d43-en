====== 2 Corinthians 05:11-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 It makes me fearful \add to think that some day I will stand before the Lord for him to judge me\add*. So I \add do everything that I can to\add* convince people \add that they should believe\add* \f + \ft Or: \add that I teach\add* sincerely \f* \add God's message\add*. God knows very well \add how I conduct my life and what I teach\add*, and I really believe that you also know it, within yourselves.
\v 12 Once again \add I say, as I write this\add*, I am not just \add trying to\add* make you think well\f + \ft Or: highly \f* of me, \add as some people will probably say that I am\add*. Instead, I am \add telling you in this letter why you have\add* good reason \add to tell those who criticize me\add* that you think highly of me. \add I am telling you this\add* so that you will know what to say to those \add teachers of false doctrine among you\add*. They are proud \add of what they have done\add*, instead of \add making sure that\add* their hearts\add are right with God and being pleased with that\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore we know what it is to honor the Lord, so we make sure to tell people what kind of God he is. God knows what kind of people we are; and I expect that you also understand whether we are doing good or evil.
\v 12 We do not want you to praise us. We only want you to know what kind of people we are, and to give you a reason to be proud of us. We do this, so that you can answer those who praise their own actions, but do not care about what they really are in their inner being.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade people. What we are is clearly seen by God, and I expect that it is also clear to your consciences.
\v 12 We are not recommending ourselves to you again, but we are giving you a reason to be proud of us, so you may have an answer for those who boast about appearances but not about what is in the heart.
