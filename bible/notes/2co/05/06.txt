\v 6 So, because God's Spirit lives in us, we are always confident that God will give us new bodies. We know that as long as we live in our bodies here on earth, we are not yet living together with the Lord Jesus in heaven.
\v 7 While we live here, we do not have our new bodies, but we are trusting that God will give them to us.
\v 8 As I said, we are confident that he will give us new bodies. We would much prefer to leave these bodies in which we are now living, and be with the Lord Jesus in our home in heaven.

\v 6 Therefore always be confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord
\v 7 (for we walk by faith, not by sight);
\v 8 So we have confidence and we would rather be away from the body and to be at home with the Lord.
