\v 4 \add It is true that\add* while we are still living in these bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that do not last forever\add*, we often groan \f + \ft doublet \f* \add because we desire to be free from them\add*. We are not longing to be without a body. Instead, \add we groan because\add* we desire to receive our new bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f* in heaven. We long for this to happen so that these bodies that are going to die some day will suddenly be changed \add into bodies\add* that will live \add forever\add*.
\v 5 It is God himself who has prepared us to \add receive\add* these \add new bodies\add*. He is also the one who has guaranteed\f + \ft Or: assured \f* us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* that this will happen. He has guaranteed it by sending his Spirit \add to live inside us now\add*.

<usfm>
\v 4 For we are living in these mortal bodies, and we long for the day when we will take off these mortal bodies. Not that we desire to die, but that we long to be clothed with our eternal bodies, just like the saying that "everything that is subject to death will be swallowed up by life."
\v 5 It is God himself who has prepared us to receive these new bodies and he guaranteed he would give us these gifts by first giving us his Spirit as his promise.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened—not that we want to be unclothed, but we would be clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
\v 5 The one who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the Spirit as a pledge.
