<usfm>
\v 4 \add It is true that\add* while we are still living in these bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that do not last forever\add*, we often groan \f + \ft doublet \f* \add because we desire to be free from them\add*. We are not longing to be without a body. Instead, \add we groan because\add* we desire to receive our new bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f* in heaven. We long for this to happen so that these bodies that are going to die some day will suddenly be changed \add into bodies\add* that will live \add forever\add*.
\v 5 It is God himself who has prepared us to \add receive\add* these \add new bodies\add*. He is also the one who has guaranteed\f + \ft Or: assured \f* us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* that this will happen. He has guaranteed it by sending his Spirit \add to live inside us now\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 For we we live in these bodies that one day will die, and we long for the day when we lay aside these bodies. Not that we are eager to die, but we are eager to be clothed with our eternal bodies, just like the saying that says, "All that dies, will be swallowed up by life."
\v 5 God himself prepares our new bodies for us, and he guarantees that we will receive them by giving us his Spirit.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened—not that we want to be unclothed, but wanting to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be absorbed by life.
\v 5 The one who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come.
