<usfm>
\v 4 \add It is true that\add* while we are still living in these bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that do not last forever\add*, we often groan \f + \ft doublet \f* \add because we desire to be free from them\add*. We are not longing to be without a body. Instead, \add we groan because\add* we desire to receive our new bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f* in heaven. We long for this to happen so that these bodies that are going to die some day will suddenly be changed \add into bodies\add* that will live \add forever\add*.
\v 5 It is God himself who has prepared us to \add receive\add* these \add new bodies\add*. He is also the one who has guaranteed\f + \ft Or: assured \f* us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* that this will happen. He has guaranteed it by sending his Spirit \add to live inside us now\add*.

\v 4 For we live in these bodies that one day will die, and we long for the day when we lay aside these bodies. Not that we are eager to die, but we are eager to be clothed with our eternal bodies, just like the saying that says, "All that dies, will be swallowed up by life."
\v 5 God himself prepares our new bodies for us, and he guarantees that we will receive them by giving us his Spirit.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened. We do not want to be unclothed. Instead, we want to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
\v 5 The one who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **while we are in this tent** - Paul speaks of the physical body as if it were a "tent." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in this tent, we groan** - The word "tent" refers to "the earthly dwelling that we live in." The word groan is a sound that a person makes when they eagerly desire to have something that is good. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2co:05:01|5:2]].
  * **being burdened** - Paul refers to the difficulties that the physical body experiences as if they were heavy objects that are difficult to carry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **We do not want to be unclothed ... we want to be clothed** - Paul speaks of the body as if it were clothing. Here "to be unclothed" refers to the death of the physical body; "to be clothed" refers to having the resurrection body that God will give. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to be unclothed** - "to be without clothes" or "to be naked"
  * **so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life** - Paul speaks of life as if it were an animal that eats "what is mortal." The physical body that will die will be replaced by a resurrection body that will live forever. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that life may swallow up what is mortal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **who gave us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come** - The Spirit is spoken of as if he was a partial downpayment toward eternal life. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2co:01:21|1:22]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
