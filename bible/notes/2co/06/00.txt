====== 2 Corinthians 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 6:2, 16, 17-18 which are quotations from the Old Testament. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Paul proved genuine by suffering and the need for believers to be separate as the temple of God.**

Paul and his companions have proved the genuineness of their calling by all that they have endured for Christ. Believers should not be partners to unbelievers because they have nothing in common and they are the temple of God.


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

**Metaphor**

Paul uses one [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] “a believer and an unbeliever tied together” meaning being partners to each other. Then he follows that with four pairs contrasting the believer with the non-believer as righteousness verses lawlessness, light verses darkness, Christ verses Satan and the temple of God verses idols.
