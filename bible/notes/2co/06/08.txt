\v 8  whether we are honored or dishonored by those we serve, and whether they say horrible things about us or give us highest praise. They accuse us of telling lies and yet we speak the truth.
\v 9  We live as people whom nobody knows, but others know us very well; some seek to punish us for telling Christ's message, others let us live for another day.
\v 10 We live with great sorrow but we always rejoice, we live as some of the poorest people but we have the treasure of the Gospel that makes many rich; you can see that we have nothing, but the truth is that all things belong to us because God owns everything and we are God's.

\v 8 in honor and dishonor, in slander and praise. We are accused of being deceitful and yet we are truthful;
\v 9 as unknown and yet well known; as dying and behold, we live; as punished for our actions but not condemned to death;
\v 10 as sorrowful but always rejoicing; as poor but making many rich; as having nothing and yet possessing all things.
