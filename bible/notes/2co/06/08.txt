===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 Sometimes people honor us; at other times, they dishonor us. Sometimes they say many evil things about us; at other times, they praise us. They accuse us of lying, even though we tell the truth. \v 9 We live like persons whom nobody knows, but some people know us very well. Some try to kill us for announcing the message about Christ, even though no one legally ever condemns us to death. \v 10 We live with great sorrow but we always rejoice. We live as some of the poorest people, but we have the treasure of the good news that makes many rich. You can see that we own nothing, but the truth is that all things belong to us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 We work in honor and dishonor, in slander and praise. We are accused of being deceitful and yet we are truthful. \v 9 We work as if we were unknown and yet well known; as dying and see! we live; as punished for our actions but not as condemned to death. \v 10 We work as sorrowful but are always rejoicing; as poor but making many rich; as having nothing and yet as possessing all things. </usfm>
