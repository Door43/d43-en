<usfm>
\v 8 in honor and dishonor, in slander and praise. We are accused of being deceitful and yet we are truthful;
\v 9 as unknown and yet well known; as dying and behold, we live; as punished for our actions but not condemned to death;
\v 10 as sorrowful but always rejoicing; as poor but making many rich; as having nothing and yet possessing all things.
