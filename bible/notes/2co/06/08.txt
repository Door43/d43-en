\v 8  \add We serve God faithfully\add* whether  \add people\add* praise us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* or  \add whether they\add* despise us, whether  \add people say\add* bad things  \add about us\f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* or  \add whether they say\add* good things  \add about us. We keep teaching\add* the truth, \add even though some people say that\add* we are deceiving  \add people\add*.
\v 9  \add Some people\add* know  \add well that we are true servants of God, and yet others\add*, who know us, refuse to  \add believe that. People have often tried to\add* kill us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add*, yet we are still alive. We have  \add often\add* been beaten, but we have not been killed \f + \ft Or:\add People have often\add* beaten us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, but  \add they\add* have not killed us \f*.
\v 10 Although we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are often very sad  \add because people have rejected our message\add*, we are always happy  \add because of all that God has done for us\add*. Even though we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are poor, we make  \add it possible for\add* many people to be  \add spiritually\add* rich. It is true that  \add in this world\add* we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* have nothing  \add valuable\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f*, but  \add because we belong to God's family\add*, all  \add that God has\add* belongs to us.

\v 8 Sometimes people honor us; at other times, they dishonor us. Sometimes they say many evil things about us; at other times, they praise us. They accuse us of lying, even though we tell the truth.
\v 9  We live like persons whom nobody knows, but some people know us very well. Some try to kill us for announcing the message about Christ, even though no one legally ever condemns us to death.
\v 10 We live with great sorrow but we always rejoice. We live as some of the poorest people, but we have the treasure of the good news that makes many rich. You can see that we own nothing, but the truth is that all things belong to us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 We work in honor and dishonor, in slander and praise. We are accused of being deceitful and yet we are truthful.
\v 9 We work as if we were unknown and yet well known; as dying and—see!—yet living; as punished for our actions but not as condemned to death.
\v 10 We work as sorrowful but are always rejoicing; as poor but making many rich; as having nothing and yet as possessing all things.
