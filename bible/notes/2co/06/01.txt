====== 2 Corinthians 06:1-3 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1  \add Therefore\add*, because I am working together with God  \add himself\add*, I say this to you very strongly: God has  \add already\add* kindly  \add forgiven you because Christ died for you\add*, so do not now  \add say\add* "It does not matter  \add if I live just to please myself\add*."
\v 2 For God said  \add long ago in the Scriptures\add*:
\p When it is the right time  \add for me\add* to help you, \add you will ask me to help you\add*, and I will hear you. Then I will  \add send\add* a Savior to help you.
\p
\add So listen to what\add* I am telling you: God  \add has sent\add* his Savior, so now is the time when  \add God is ready to\add* save  \add people from the guilt of their sins\add*.


\p
\v 3 Neither I nor the men  \add working\add* with me do anything that would hinder people from trusting in Christ, and so we cannot be accused \f + \ft Or:no one can accuse  \add us\add* \f* \add of not\add* serving  \add God properly\add*.

\v 1  And since we are as holy before God as Christ is, we now work together with God, and we beg you not to receive God's loving mercy and then have it fail to do a great work in you.
\v 2 For God said, 
\q "In a time when I displayed my loving mercy, I listened to you, 
\q And in a time when I completed the work of my salvation, I knelt down and helped you.
\m Look, today is the day I show you the riches of my loving mercy; today is the day I love you so much that I rescue you for myself.
\p
\v 3 We are careful about how we live, and we are careful about our reputation so that no one has reason to accuse us of wrong when we are serving God.

\v 1 And so, working together, we beg you not to receive the grace of God to no effect.  
\v 2 For he says,
\q In a favorable time I paid attention to you,
\q And in the day of salvation I helped you.
\m Look, now is the favorable time; look, now is the day of salvation.
\v 3 We certainly do not want to give anyone reason to do wrong, in order that no one might blame our ministry,
