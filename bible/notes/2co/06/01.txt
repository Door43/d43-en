====== 2 Corinthians 06:1-3 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 1 \add Therefore\add*, because I am working together with God \add himself\add*, I say this to you very strongly: God has \add already\add* kindly \add forgiven you because Christ died for you\add*, so do not now \add say\add* "It does not matter \add if I live just to please myself\add*." \v 2 For God said \add long ago in the Scriptures\add*: \p When it is the right time \add for me\add* to help you, \add you will ask me to help you\add*, and I will hear you. Then I will \add send\add* a Savior to help you. \p \add So listen to what\add* I am telling you: God \add has sent\add* his Savior, so now is the time when \add God is ready to\add* save \add people from the guilt of their sins\add*.

\p \v 3 Neither I nor the men \add working\add* with me do anything that would hinder people from trusting in Christ, and so we cannot be accused \f + \ft Or:no one can accuse \add us\add* \f* \add of not\add* serving \add God properly\add*. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 We work together, and we beg you not to receive the gift of God's love in a way that makes no difference for you. \v 2 For God said, \q "At a time when I displayed my loving mercy, I listened to you, \q And when I completed the work of my salvation, I helped you." \m Look, this is the day when God is having mercy on you; this is the day that he is rescuing you. \m \p \v 3 We certainly do not want to give anyone reason to do wrong, because we want no one to accuse us of preaching the good news in order to encourage evil doing. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \c 6 \nb \v 1 And so, working together, we beg you not to receive the grace of God to no effect. \v 2 For he says, \q "In a favorable time I paid attention to you, \q And in the day of salvation I helped you." \m Look, now is the favorable time; look, now is the day of salvation. \v 3 We do not place a stumbling block in front of anyone, for we do not wish our ministry to be brought into disrepute. </usfm>
