====== 2 Corinthians 06:1-3 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1  \add Therefore\add*, because I am working together with God  \add himself\add*, I say this to you very strongly: God has  \add already\add* kindly  \add forgiven you because Christ died for you\add*, so do not now  \add say\add* "It does not matter  \add if I live just to please myself\add*."
\v 2 For God said  \add long ago in the Scriptures\add*:
\p When it is the right time  \add for me\add* to help you, \add you will ask me to help you\add*, and I will hear you. Then I will  \add send\add* a Savior to help you.
\p
\add So listen to what\add* I am telling you: God  \add has sent\add* his Savior, so now is the time when  \add God is ready to\add* save  \add people from the guilt of their sins\add*.


\p
\v 3 Neither I nor the men  \add working\add* with me do anything that would hinder people from trusting in Christ, and so we cannot be accused \f + \ft Or:no one can accuse  \add us\add* \f* \add of not\add* serving  \add God properly\add*.

<usfm>
\v 1  We work together, and we beg you not to receive the gift of God's love in a way that makes no difference for you.
\v 2 For God said, 
\q "At a time when I displayed my loving mercy, I listened to you, 
\q And when I completed the work of my salvation, I helped you."
\m Look, this is the day when God is having mercy on you; this is the day that he is rescuing you.
\m
\p
\v 3 We certainly do not want to give anyone reason to do wrong, because we want no one to accuse us of preaching the good news in order to encourage evil doing.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 And so, working together, we beg you not to receive the grace of God to no effect.  
\v 2 For he says,
\q "In a favorable time I paid attention to you,
\q And in the day of salvation I helped you."
\m Look, now is the favorable time; look, now is the day of salvation.
\v 3 We do not place a stumbling block in front of anyone, for we do not wish our ministry to be brought into disrepute.
