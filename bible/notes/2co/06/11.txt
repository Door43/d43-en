\v 12 We are not  \add treating you as though we do not\add* love you, but you are  \add treating us as though you do\add* not love us.
\v 13 In return  \add for our loving you, will you not\add* love  \add us\add* \f + \ft idiom \f* just as  \add much as we love you?\add* I am writing  \add to you\add* as if you were my own children.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 You heard our testimony; we have spoken the whole the truth to you, fellow believers at Corinth. We have opened our hearts wide to you.
\v 12 We have shown you that we freely love you, but you seem to have closed off your hearts toward us.
\v 13 It would be a fair exchange—I am speaking as to children—for you to love us in return.

===== ULB: =====

\v 11 We have spoken the whole truth to you, Corinthians, and our heart is wide open.
\v 12 Your hearts are not restrained by us, but you are restrained by your own feelings.
\v 13 Now in fair exchange—I speak as to children—open your hearts wide.
