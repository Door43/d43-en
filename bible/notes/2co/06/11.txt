<usfm> \v 11 You heard our testimony; we have spoken the whole the truth to you, fellow believers at Corinth. We have opened our hearts wide to you. \v 12 We have shown you that we freely love you, but you seem to have closed off your hearts toward us. \v 13 It would be a fair exchange—I am speaking as to children—for you to love us in return. \p </usfm>
