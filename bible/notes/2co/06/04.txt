\v 4 Instead, in everything  \add that we\f + \ft exclusive \f* say and do\add*, we show  \add people\add* that we serve God faithfully. We patiently endure  \add all the things that happen to us.

\v 5 Sometimes we have been beaten  \add and bound\add* \f + \ft Or:People have beaten  \add us and tied us\add* \f* \add with\add* chains in prison. \add Angry mobs\add* have attacked us, \add wanting to kill us\add*. We have continued working  \add for God until we had no more strength to work\add*. We have had many sleepless nights, and we have  \add often been without food\add*.
\v 6  \add All that we think about and all that we do is\add* pure  \add in God's sight\add*. Knowing  \add how God wants us to conduct our lives, we do what pleases him\add*. We are patient  \add with those who oppose us\add*. We are kind  \add to all people. We depend on\add* the Holy Spirit  \add to help us\add*. We love people sincerely  \add as God wants us to love them\add*.

\v 4 We have proved again and again that we are God's true servants. We endure great suffering, we face with courage people who hurt us, and we live through hard times.
\v 5  People have beaten us very badly; others have locked us up in prisons; we were the cause for people to riot; we have done hard physical labor; we have passed many long nights without sleep, and we have often gone with very little food.
\v 6 But in all this, our lives are pure, our knowledge is deep, and we are able to wait until God ends our suffering. We know how kind Christ is to us; we are filled with the Holy Spirit, and we love others.
\v 7 We live according to God's true Word, and we have God's power. By means of Christ, God has put us right with himself. This is the truth that we continuously believe; it is like armor that a soldier wears, and like weapons for both of his hands.

<usfm>
\v 4 Instead, we prove ourselves by all our actions,  that we are God's servants—in much endurance, affliction, distress, hardship,
\v 5 beatings, imprisonments, riots, in hard work, in sleepless nights, in hunger,
\v 6 in purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love;
\v 7 in the word of truth, in the power of God—with the armor of righteousness for the right hand and for the left.
