===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Is it good that you are so angry?** - God used this rhetorical question to scold Jonah for being angry about something he should not have been angry about. In some languages it is more natural to use a statement: "Your anger is not good." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **went out of the city** - "left the city of Nineveh"
  * **what might become of the city** - "what would happen to the city" (UDB). Jonah wanted to see if God would destroy the city or not destroy it.
