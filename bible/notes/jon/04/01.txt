====== Jonah 04:1-3 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 But Jonah was very distressed \add that God had not destroyed Nineveh\add*. He became very angry. \add The people of Nineveh were non-Jews, and Jonah did not think that God should act mercifully toward anyone who was not a Jew\add*.
\v 2 He prayed to Yahweh, "O Yahweh, what you have done is what I thought that you would do, before I left home \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. That is why I \add decided\add* immediately to run away, and go to Tarshish \add land\add*, because I knew that you, O God, act very kindly and compassionately \add toward all people\add*. You do not quickly become angry with people who do evil. You love people very much, and you change your mind about punishing \add people who sin\add*.
\v 3 \add So\add* now, O Yahweh, \add since you will not destroy Nineveh city as you said you would\add*, allow me to die, because it would be better for me to die than to \add continue to\add* live."

\v 1 But Jonah felt that it was very bad that God had not destroyed Nineveh. He became very angry.
\v 2 He prayed to Yahweh, "Oh, Yahweh, what you have done is just what I thought that you would do even before I left home. The reason I ran away to go to Tarshish was to prevent this from happening, because I knew that you act very kindly and compassionately toward all people. You do not quickly become angry with people who do evil. You love people very much, and you change your mind about punishing people who sin.
\v 3 So now, Oh Yahweh, since you will not destroy Nineveh as you said you would, please allow me to die, because now it would be better for me to die than to continue to live."

\v 1 But this seemed terribly wrong to Jonah and he became very angry.
\v 2 So Jonah prayed to Yahweh and said, "Ah, Yahweh, Is this not just what I said when I was back in my own country? Therefore I acted preemptively and tried to flee to Tarshish; because I knew that you are a gracious God, compassionate, slow to anger, abundant in lovingkindness, and you relent from sending disaster.
\v 3 Therefore now, O Yahweh, I beg you, take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live."
