\v 8 It came about that when the sun rose the next morning, God prepared a hot east wind. Also, the sun beat down on Jonah's head and he became faint. Then Jonah wished that he might die. He said to himself, "It is better for me to die than to live."
\v 9 Then God said to Jonah, "Is it good that you are so angry about the plant?"  And Jonah said, "It is good that I am angry, even to death."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **God prepared a hot east wind** - AT: "God caused a hot wind from the east to blow on Jonah." If your word for wind can only mean a cool or cold wind, then it might work to translate it like this: "God sent a very hot warmth from the east to Jonah."
  * **the sun beat down** - the sun was very hot"
  * **on Jonah's head** - Jonah may have felt the heat most on his head. AT: "on Jonah" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **he became faint** - AT: "he became very weak" or "he lost his strength."
  * **It is better for me to die than to live** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jon:04:01|4:3]].
  * **Is it good that you are so angry about the plant?**  - God used a rhetorical question to scold Jonah for being angry that the plant died but wanting God to kill the people of Nineveh. AT: "Your anger about the plant dying is not good." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) You should be more concerned about the people in Nineveh dying than about the plant dying. (See; [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **even to death** - "Now I am angry enough to die!" (UDB)
