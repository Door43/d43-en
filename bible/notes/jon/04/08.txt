\v 8 And it came about that when the sun rose the next morning, God prepared a hot east wind. Also, the sun beat down on Jonah's head and he became faint. Then Jonah wished that he might die. He said to himself, "It is better for me to die than to live."
\v 9 And God said to Jonah, "Is it good that you are so angry about the plant?"  And Jonah said, "It is good that I am angry, even to death."
