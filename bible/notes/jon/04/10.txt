\v 10 But Yahweh said \add to him\add*, "You have been concerned about my \add causing\add* that vine \add to wither\add*, even though you did not take care of it, and you did not make it grow. It just grew up during one night, and it completely withered \add at the end of\add* the next night.
\v 11 But there are more than 120,000 people in Nineveh who \add are very young, and because of that\add*, they cannot tell which is their right hand and which is their left hand, and there are also many cattle, \add and none of these have done anything to displease me\add*. So is it not right for me to be concerned about the people of that huge city, \add and not want to destroy them\add*?\f + \ft Or: it is certainly right for me to be concerned about the people of that huge city \add and not want to destroy them\add*! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 10 But Yahweh said to him, "You were concerned about that vine when I caused it to wither, even though you did not take care of it, and you did not make it grow. It just grew up during one night and it completely withered at the end of the next night.
\v 11 But there are more than 120,000 people in Nineveh, that huge city, who cannot tell right from wrong, and there are also many cattle. So is it not right for me to be concerned about those people, and not want to destroy them?"

\v 10 Yahweh said, "You have had compassion for the plant, for which you have not labored, nor did you make it grow. It grew up in a night and perished in a night.
\v 11 So as for me, should I not have compassion for Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120 thousand people who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also many cattle?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yahweh said**  - "Yahweh said to Jonah"
  * **perished**  - "died"
  * **should I not have compassion for Nineveh, that great city**  - God used this question to emphasize his claim that he should have compassion on Nineveh. In some languages it is more natural to use a statement to express the emphasis: "I certainly should have compassion for Nineveh, that important city." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **in which there are more**  - This can also be the beginning of a new sentence. "There are more" or "It has more."
  * **120 thousand people**  - 120,000 people (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers|Translating Unknowns - Numbers]])
  * **cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand**  - This may be a way of saying "cannot discern between right and wrong."
  * **cannot discern between**  - "cannot tell which is" (UDB) or "do not know which is"
  * **and also many cattle?**  - "and there are also many cattle."
