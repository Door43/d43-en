\v 10 But Yahweh said \add to him\add*, "You have been concerned about my \add causing\add* that vine \add to wither\add*, even though you did not take care of it, and you did not make it grow. It just grew up during one night, and it completely withered \add at the end of\add* the next night.
\v 11 But there are more than 120,000 people in Nineveh who \add are very young, and because of that\add*, they cannot tell which is their right hand and which is their left hand, and there are also many cattle, \add and none of these have done anything to displease me\add*. So is it not right for me to be concerned about the people of that huge city, \add and not want to destroy them\add*?\f + \ft Or: it is certainly right for me to be concerned about the people of that huge city \add and not want to destroy them\add*! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 10 But Yahweh said to him, "You were concerned about that vine when I caused it to wither, even though you did not take care of it, and you did not make it grow. It just grew up during one night and it completely withered at the end of the next night.
\v 11 But there are more than 120,000 people in Nineveh, that huge city, who cannot tell right from wrong, and there are also many cattle. So is it not right for me to be concerned about those people, and not want to destroy them?"

\v 10 Yahweh said, "You have had compassion for the plant, for which you have not labored, nor did you make it grow. It grew up in a night and died in a night.
\v 11 So as for me, should I not have compassion for Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know the difference between their right hand and their left hand, and also many cattle?"
