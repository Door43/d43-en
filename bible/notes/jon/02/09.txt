===== Translation Notes: =====

This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [[:en:bible:notes:jon:02:01|2:2]].

  * **But as for me, I** - This expression in English shows that there is a contrast between the people Jonah had just spoken about and himself. They paid attention to useless gods but he would worship Yahweh. It can also be translated as "But I."
  * **I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving** - This means that Jonah would thank God while he offered a sacrifice to him. It is not clear whether Jonah planned to thank God by singing or shouting joyfully. 
  * **Salvation comes from Yahweh** - "Salvation" is a noun. Its meaning can also be expressed with a verb: Yahweh is the one who saves people."
  * **upon the dry land**  - "upon the ground" or "onto the shore"
