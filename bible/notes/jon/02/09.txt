===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [[:en:bible:notes:jon:02:01|2:2]].

  * **But as for me, I** - This expression in English shows that there is a contrast between the people Jonah had just spoken about and himself. They paid attention to useless gods, but he would worship Yahweh. AT: "But I."
  * **I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving** - This means that Jonah would thank God while he offered a sacrifice to him. It is not clear whether Jonah planned to thank God by singing or shouting joyfully.
  * **Salvation comes from Yahweh** - This can be stated in the active. AT: "Yahweh is the one who saves people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **upon the dry land** - "upon the ground" or "onto the shore"
