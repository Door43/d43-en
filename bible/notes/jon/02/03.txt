===== Translation Notes: =====

This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [[:en:bible:notes:jon:02:01|2:2]].  In verse 4 Jonah spoke of something he had prayed before this prayer.

  * **into the heart of the seas**- "to the bottom of the sea"
  * **the currents surrounded me**- "the sea water closed in around me"
  * **I am driven out**  - This can be translated with an active clause: "You have driven me away" or "You have sent me away." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **from before your eyes**  - "from you." When Jonah said "your eyes" he was speaking about all of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:synecdoche]])
  * **How can I ever again gaze at your holy temple?"**  Jonah used this rhetorical question to show how sad he was that he would never see Yahweh's temple again. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
