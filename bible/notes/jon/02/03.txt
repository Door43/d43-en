===== Translation Notes: =====

This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [[:en:bible:notes:jon:02:01|2:2]].  In verse 4 Jonah spoke of something he had prayed before this prayer.

  * **into the heart of the seas** - "to the bottom of the sea"
  * **the currents surrounded me** - "the sea water closed in around me"
  * **I am driven out** - This can be translated with an active clause: "You have driven me away" or "You have sent me away." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from before your eyes** - "from you." When Jonah said "your eyes" he was speaking about all of Yahweh. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **How can I ever again gaze at your holy temple?"** - Jonah used this rhetorical question to show how sad he was that he would never see Yahweh's temple again. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
