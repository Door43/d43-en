\v 5 The waters closed over me to take my life;
\q the deep was all around me;
\q seaweed was wrapped around my head.
\q
\v 6 I went down to the bases of the mountains;
\q the earth with its bars closed upon me forever.
\q Yet you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh, my God!

===== Translation Notes: =====

This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [[:en:bible:notes:jon:02:01|2:2]].

  * **The waters** - "The waters" refers to the sea.
  * **to take my life** - "and were about to kill me."
  * **the deep was all around me** - "the deep water was all around me"
  * **seaweed** - "grass that grows in the sea"
  * **the earth with its bars closed upon me forever** - Jonah used a metaphor to compare the earth to a prison. AT: "The earth was like a prison that was about to lock me in forever." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yet you brought up my life from the pit**  - "But you saved my life from the place of the dead" or "But you saved me from the place where the dead people are"
  * **Yahweh, my God!** - In some languages it may be more natural to put this at the beginning of the sentence or next to the word "you."
