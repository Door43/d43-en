\v 11 The storm kept getting worse and the waves kept getting bigger. So one of the sailors asked Jonah, "What should we do with you in order to make the sea become calm for us?"
\v 12 He replied, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea. If you do that, it will become calm for you. I know that this terrible storm happened because I did not do what Yahweh told me to do."
\p
\v 13 But the sailors did not want to do that. Instead, they tried hard to row the ship back to the land. But they could not do that, because the storm continued to get worse.

\v 11 Then they said to Jonah, "What should we do to you so that the sea will calm down for us?" For the sea became more and more violent.
\v 12 Jonah said to them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will be calm for you, for I know that it is because of me that this great storm is happening to you."
\p
\v 13 Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get them back to the land, but they could not do it because the sea was becoming more and more violent against them.

  * **do to you so that the sea will calm down** - "do with you in order to make the sea become calm" 
  * **the sea became more and more violent** - This was the reason that the men asked Jonah what they should do. The reason can also be found at the beginning of verse 11 in the UDB.

  * **Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get them back to the land** - The men did not want to throw Jonah into the sea, so they rowed hard as if they were digging into the water to get back to land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
