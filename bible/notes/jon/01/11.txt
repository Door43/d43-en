\v 11 Then they said to Jonah, "What should we do to you so that the sea will calm down for us?" For the sea grew more and more violent.
\v 12 Jonah said to them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will be calm for you, for I know that it is because of me  that this great storm is upon you."
\v 13 Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get them back to the land, but they could not do it because the sea grew more and more violent against them.
