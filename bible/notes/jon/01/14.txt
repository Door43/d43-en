<usfm>
\v 14 Therefore they prayed to Yahweh, and \add one of them\add* prayed, "O Yahweh, please do not let us drown because of our causing this man to die. O Yahweh, you have done what you wanted to do. \add We do not know\add* \add if this man has sinned. If\add* he has not sinned, do not consider that we are guilty of sinning when we cause him to die!"
\v 15 Then they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea. Then the sea became calm.
\v 16 \add When that happened\add*, the sailors became greatly awed at Yahweh's \add power\add*. So they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and they strongly promised \add him that they would do things that would please him\add*.

\v 14 Therefore, they cried out to Yahweh and said, "We beg you, O Yahweh, we beg you, do not let us perish on account of this man’s life, and do not lay upon us the guilt of his death, because you, O Yahweh, have done just as it pleased you."
\v 15 So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging.
\v 16 Then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly. They offered sacrifices to Yahweh and made vows.
