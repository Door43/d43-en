\v 8 Then they said to Jonah, "Please tell us who is the cause of this evil that is upon us. What is your occupation, and where did you come from?  What is your country, and from which people are you?"
\v 9 Jonah said to them, "I am a Hebrew; and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land."
\v 10 Then the men were even more afraid and said to Jonah, "What is this that you have done?" For the men knew that he was running away from the presence of Yahweh, because he had told them.
