  * **the news**  - "Jonah's message"
  * **He rose up from his throne**  - "He got up from his throne" or "He stood up from his throne." The king left his throne to show that was acting humbly.
  * **throne**  - A throne is a chair that the king sits on to show that he is the king.
  * **He sent out a proclamation that said** - "He sent out an official announcement that said" or "he sent his messengers to announce to the people in Nineveh"
  * **nobles**  - "advisors" (UDB). These were important men who helped the king rule the city.
  * **herd nor flock**  - This refers to two kinds of animals that people care for. It can be translated as "cattle or sheep."
  * **Let them not eat, nor drink water**  - "They must not eat or drink anything." The reason they were not to eat or drink anything can be made explicit by adding to it "in order to show that they are sorry for their sins."
