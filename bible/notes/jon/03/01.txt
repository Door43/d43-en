\c 3
\p
\v 1 The word of Yahweh came to Jonah a second time, saying,
\v 2 "Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I command you to give."
\v 3 So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh in obedience to the word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh was a very large city, one of three days' journey.
