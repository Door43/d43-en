  * **But let both** - "Let both"
  * **let both man and animal be covered with sackcloth** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "let people and animals wear sackcloth" or "let people cover themselves and their animals with sackcloth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **animal** - The word "animal" refers to animals that people own.

  * **the violence that is in his hands** - This means "the violent things that he does"
  * **Who knows?** - The king used this rhetorical question to get the people to think about something that they might not have thought possible, that if they would stop sinning, God might not kill them. It could be translated as a statement: "We do not know." Or it could be stated as a word and be part of the next sentence: "Perhaps." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
