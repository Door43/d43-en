\v 4 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak to the
king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
\v 5 And the king’s servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
\v 6 So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman
said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?
