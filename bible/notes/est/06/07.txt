\v 7 And Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king delights to honor,
\v 8 let a royal robe be brought that the king has used, and a horse that the king has ridden and on whose head is the royal insignia.
\v 9 Then let the robe and the horse be delivered to one of the king’s most noble princes.
