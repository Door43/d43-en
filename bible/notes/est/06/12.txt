  * **with his head covered** - People often covered their head to show that they were either extremely sad or ashamed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Zeresh** - See how you translated this woman's name in [[:en:bible:notes:est:06:12|6:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **before whom you have begun to fall ... you will certainly fall before him** - They spoke as if Haman and Mordecai were in a battle, and Haman was beginning to lose the battle.

  * **you will not overcome him** - "you will not win against him." They spoke as if Haman and Mordecai were in a battle. Here overcoming a person represents having greater honor than that person. AT: "you will not have greater honor than he has" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
