\v 9 Haman went out that day joyful and glad at heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king’s gate, that Mordecai neither rose up nor trembled before him with any fear, he was filled with rage against Mordecai.
\v 10 Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went to his own house. He sent for his friends and gathered them together, with Zeresh his wife.
\v 11 Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches and the number of his many sons, how he had advanced above all the officials and the servants of the king.
