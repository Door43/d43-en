\v 9 Haman was feeling very happy as he left the banquet. But then he saw Mordecai sitting at the gate of the palace. Mordecai did not stand up and tremble fearfully in front of Haman, so Haman became extremely angry.
\v 10 However, he did not show that he was angry; he just went home. Then he gathered together his wife Zeresh and his friends,
\v 11 and he boasted to them about being very rich, and about having many children. He also boasted that the king had greatly honored him, and that the king had promoted him\f + \ft Or: given him the second-most important job in the empire \f*, so that all the other officials had to respect him.

\v 9 Haman was feeling very happy when he left the feast. But he saw Mordecai sitting at the gate of the palace, and once again, Mordecai did not stand up or shake with fear in front of him. So Haman was filled with anger toward Mordecai.
\v 10 However, he did nothing to show that he was angry. He went to his house and gathered his friends. He also called for his wife, Zeresh.
\v 11 Haman told them all about the great riches he had accumulated. He talked about his many sons, and how he had achieved more than all the other officials and the servants of the king.

\v 9 Haman went out that day joyful and glad at heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king's gate, that Mordecai neither rose up nor trembled before him with any fear, he was filled with rage against Mordecai.
\v 10 Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went to his own house. He sent for his friends and gathered them together, with Zeresh his wife.
\v 11 Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches and the number of his many sons, how he had advanced above all the officials and the servants of the king.
