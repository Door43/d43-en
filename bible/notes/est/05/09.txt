\v 9 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
\v 10 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.
\v 11 And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
