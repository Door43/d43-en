\v 9 So Hathach went to Esther and told her what Mordecai said.
\v 10 Then Esther ordered Hathach to return to Mordecai, and to tell him this:
\v 11 "All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that no one can come before the king unless the king invites him to come. There is only one result of breaking this law: the person is put to death. The only exception would be that the king would hold out his golden scepter to someone who came before him, and that would be the sign that the king would permit that person to live. About my own contact with the king, I have not been called to come to the king for thirty days."
\v 12 So Hathach went back to Mordecai and told him what Esther had said.

\v 9 So Hathak went and told Esther what Mordecai had said.
\v 10 Then Esther spoke to Hathak and told him to go back to Mordecai.
\v 11 She said, "All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner courtyard without being summoned, there is only one law: that he must be put to death—except for anyone to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live. I have not been called to come to the king these thirty days."
\v 12 So Hathak reported Esther's words to Mordecai.

  * **if any man or woman goes to the king ... the king holds out the golden scepter** - This conditional clause can be expressed as a statement. It may also be helpful to divide it into two sentences. AT: "no man or woman is allowed to go to the king inside the inner courtyard unless the king summons them. The person who breaks this law will be executed unless the king holds out his golden scepter to him" 
  * **thirty days** - "30 days" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
