\v 9 So Hathach went to Esther and told her what Mordecai said.
\v 10 Then Esther ordered Hathach to return to Mordecai, and to tell him this:
\v 11 "All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that no one can come before the king unless the king invites him to come. There is only one result of breaking this law: the person is put to death. The only exception would be that the king would hold out his golden scepter to someone who came before him, and that would be the sign that the king would permit that person to live. About my own contact with the king, I have not been called to come to the king for thirty days."
\v 12 So Hathach went back to Mordecai and told him what Esther had said.
