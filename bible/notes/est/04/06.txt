\v 6 Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square in front of the gate to the king's palace.
\v 7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened. He told him how much silver Haman had promised to deposit in the king's treasury in order to kill the Jews.
\v 8 Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the decree that had been issued in Susa, so that he might show it to Esther. Mordecai wanted to command Esther to take action about this order from the king and to beg favor from the king. He wanted her to go to the king and try to help the Jewish people.

\v 6 So Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square in front of the king's gate.
\v 7 Mordecai reported to him all that had happened to him, and the total amount of the silver that Haman had promised to weigh out and put into the king's treasuries in order to put the Jews to death.
\v 8 He also gave him a copy of the decree that was issued in Susa for the Jews' destruction. He did this so that Hathach could show it to Esther, and that he should give her the responsibility of going to the king to beg for his favor, and to plead with him on behalf of her people.
