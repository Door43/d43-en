\v 6 Hathach went to Mordecai at the plaza of the city in front of the gate to the king's palace.
\v 7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened. He told him how much money Haman had promised to deposit in the accounts of those who helped to kill all of the Jews.
\v 8 Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the decree that had been issued in Susa, which said that all the Jews must be killed, so that he might show it to Esther.
