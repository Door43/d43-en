\v 20 Mordecai recorded these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,
\v 21 obligating them to keep the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of Adar every year.
\v 22 These were the days when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and the time when their sorrow was turned to joy, and from mourning into a holiday. They were to make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending gifts of food to one another, and gifts to the poor.
