\v 23 So the Jews agreed to do what Mordecai wrote. They agreed to celebrate on those days every year.
\v 24 They would remember how Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, became an enemy of all the Jews. They would remember how he had made an evil plan to kill the Jews, and that he had thrown lots to find a day to crush and destroy them.
\v 25 They would remember that when the king learned about Haman's plan, he arranged that the evil plan to kill the Jews would result instead in Haman's own destruction, that Haman would be killed in place of the Jews, that he and that his sons would be hanged.

\v 23 So the Jews continued the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them.
\v 24 At that time Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and he threw Pur (that is, he threw lots), to crush and destroy them.
\v 25 But when the matter came before the king, he gave orders by letters that the wicked plan Haman developed against the Jews should come back on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
