\v 23 So the Jews committed themselves to continue what they had begun and what Mordecai had written to them.
\v 24  At that time Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy
them. He  had cast Pur, that is the lot, to crush and to destroy them.
\v 25 Yet when the matter came before the king, he gave orders by letters that the wicked plan that Haman had devised
against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
