\v 5 When Haman learned that Mordecai refused to kneel down or prostrate himself to him, he became extremely angry.
\v 6 He was too proud to want to punish only Mordecai. Because the king's servants had made it known that Mordecai was Jewish, Haman wanted all the Jews to be killed. So this matter became an opportunity to kill all the Jews everywhere in Ahasuerus' kingdom.

\v 5 When Haman saw that Mordecai did not kneel and bow down to him, Haman was filled with rage.
\v 6 He had contempt for the idea of killing only Mordecai, for the king's servants had told him who Mordecai's people were. Haman wanted to exterminate all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were in the entire kingdom of Ahasuerus.
