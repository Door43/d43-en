\v 7 King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and Mordecai, "Because Haman tried to get rid of all the Jews, I have given to Esther everything that belonged to Haman, and I have ordered \add my soldiers\add* to hang Haman.
\v 8 So now I am also permitting you to write other letters, \add to save\add* your people. You may put my name on the letters, and use my ring to seal them because no letter that has my name on it and which is sealed with my ring can ever be changed."

\v 7 King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, "Because Haman tried to get rid of all the Jews, I have given to Esther everything that belonged to Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows.
\v 8 So now I am also permitting you to write another letter with a new decree in it, so that you may save your people. You may put my name on the letters and use my ring to seal them. This is  because no letter that has my name on it and that is sealed with my ring can ever be revoked."

\v 7 King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Look, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he was going to attack the Jews.
\v 8 Write another decree for the Jews in the name of the king, and seal it with the king’s ring. For the decree that has already been written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s ring cannot be revoked."
