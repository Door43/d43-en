\v 10-11 They wrote in those letters that the Jews in every city were permitted by the king to gather together to protect themselves. They also were permitted to kill any group of soldiers who attacked them. They were also permitted to kill the women and children of those who attacked them, and to take the possessions of the people whom they killed.
\v 12 \add All this was to be done\add* on March 7th of the following year. Mordecai signed the king's name on the letters, and sealed them with the seal that was on the king's ring. Then he gave them to messengers, who rode on fast horses that had been raised especially for the king.

\v 10 Mordecai wrote the decree in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king’s signet ring. He sent the documents by couriers riding on the fast horses that were used in the king’s service, bred in the king's stables.
\v 11 The king gave to the Jews living in every city permission to gather together and to fight together to protect their lives. He allowed them to kill any armed men in any province, belonging to any people group, who might attack them or their families, or who might try to take their possessions.
\v 12 This was to be in effect in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which was the month Adar.
