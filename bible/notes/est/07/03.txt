\v 3 Esther replied, "O king, if you are pleased with me, and if you are willing to do \add what I ask\add*, save me, and save my people. That is what I want you to do for me.
\v 4 \add It is as though\add* I and my people \add are cattle\add* that have been sold to be slaughtered. \add It is as though\add* we have been sold to people who want to completely destroy us.
