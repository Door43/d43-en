\v 3 Esther replied, "O king, if you are pleased with me, and if you are willing to do \add what I ask\add*, save me, and save my people. That is what I want you to do for me.
\v 4 \add It is as though\add* I and my people \add are cattle\add* that have been sold to be slaughtered. \add It is as though\add* we have been sold to people who want to completely destroy us. If we had only been sold to people to become their male and female slaves, I would not say anything, because that would have been a matter too small to bother you, the king."
\v 5 Then King Xerxes asked her, "Who is the one who would want to do such a \add terrible\add* thing? Where is he?"

\v 3 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my
life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
\v 4 for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and
bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s damage.
\v 5 Then spoke the king Ahasuerus and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dared presume in his heart
to do so?
