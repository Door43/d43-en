\v 3 Esther replied, "O king, if you are pleased with me, and if you are willing to do \add what I ask\add*, save me, and save my people. That is what I want you to do for me.
\v 4 \add It is as though\add* I and my people \add are cattle\add* that have been sold to be slaughtered. \add It is as though\add* we have been sold to people who want to completely destroy us. If we had only been sold to people to become their male and female slaves, I would not say anything, because that would have been a matter too small to bother you, the king."
\v 5 Then King Xerxes asked her, "Who is the one who would want to do such a \add terrible\add* thing? Where is he?"

\v 3 Esther replied, "If you are pleased with me, my king, and if you are willing to do what I ask, save my life! And save the lives of my people.
\v 4 For I and my people have been condemned to destruction by a decree. I and my people, we have been handed over to be annihilated—to be killed, destroyed. If we had only been sold into slavery, I would have kept quiet, for that kind of trouble would not have been worth bothering you about."
\v 5 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, "Who is the man who did this? Where is the one whose heart is full of this kind of evil?"

\v 3 Then Queen Esther replied, "If I have found favor in your eyes, king, and if it pleases you, let my life be given to me—this is my petition, and I request this also for my people.
\v 4 For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, killed, and annihilated. If we had only been sold into slavery, as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, for no such distress as this would justify disturbing the king."
\v 5 Then King Ahasuerus and said to Esther the queen, "Who is he? Where is the one who has filled his heart to do such a thing?"
