===== translationNotes: =====

  * **There was a certain Jew** - This introduces Mordecai as a new character in the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **Susa** - Translate the name of this city as in [[:en:bible:notes:est:01:01|1:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **son of Jair son of Shimei son of Kish** - "Jair," "Shimei," and "Kish" are men from whom "Mordecai" is the male descendant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Benjamite** - "of the tribe of Benjamin" 
  * **He had been taken away ... king of Babylonia carried away** - This background information explains how Mordecai came to live in Susa. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylonia carried him and other exiles away along with Jehoiachin, king of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He had been taken away from Jerusalem** - The Hebrew text leaves unclear who is being spoken of here. It is perhaps Kish, who seems to have been the great-grandfather of Mordecai. If it was Mordecai himself, then he would be extremely old at the time of the events concerning Esther. Many modern versions leave this matter unclear. A few versions, including the UDB, choose to assume that it was Mordecai who had been taken away from Jerusalem.
  * **Jehoiachin, king of Judah** - (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
