\v 19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.
\v 20 Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of
Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
\v 21 In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of
those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
