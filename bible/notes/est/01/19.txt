\v 19 So if it pleases you, O king, you should write a law. \add Like all the other\add* laws of Persia and Media, it will be a law that no one can change\f + \ft Or: cannot be changed. \f* Write a law that states that Queen Vashti will never be allowed to see you again \add and will not continue to be the queen\add*. Then you can choose another woman to be queen, a woman who deserves to be queen more than Vashti does.
\v 20 Then, when everyone in your empire hears what you have commanded, all the women, including those who are important and those who are not important, will respect and obey their husbands."

\v 19 So if it pleases your Majesty, you should write a law, like all the laws of Persia and Media, to be a law that no one can change. This law should say that Queen Vashti will never be allowed to see you again, and you will choose another woman to be queen, a woman who deserves to be queen more than she does.
\v 20 When everyone in your empire hears what you have commanded, all the wives, those who are important and those who are not important, will honor their husbands."

\v 19 If it pleases the king, let a royal decree be sent out from him, and let it be written in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti may no longer come before him. Let the king give her position as queen to another who is better than she.
\v 20 When the king's decree is proclaimed throughout all his vast kindom, all the wives will honor their husbands, from the greatest to the least significant."
