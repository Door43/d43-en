====== Adding Translation Academy Links ======

Before adding a tA link to a page, check here to see if it already exists in [[en/ta/ta-topics]]

  * Add the link to the page using the correct link syntax.
  * If you are unsure of the syntax of a tA link, see "Page Link" column of the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ocRDg1_jdGI7PjnKbZe19qd_fmnHqOv4cDpjM0pdmFs/edit?usp=sharing​|Translation Studio Topics - Links]] list on Google Drive.


=== If the topic is not on the Translation Academy Topics Page: ===
  - Type in "(See talink TOPIC)" at the end of the Translation Note.
  - Add a tag syntax on the Bible chunk page above the Discussion syntax: 
<code>{{tag>talink}}</code>
  * If there is already a tag for the KT link, leave a space and add to it like this: 
<code>{{tag>ktlink talink}}</code>

  * The tA team will see the list of chunks that need tA page/video/module here: [[en/ta/ta-needed]]

  * Once they have created the page, they will delete the tag.
