====== How to Create Translation Notes ======

==== These are some ideas to guide how the Translation Notes are created: ====

  * Select a portion from the ULB that needs a note and write it in bold by one of the bullets under "Translation Notes."
  * Write a translation suggestion that can be used in place of the portion you have selected.
      * If the suggestion is synonymous with the ULB, simply add the suggestion with double-quotes around it.
      * If the suggestion includes making implied information explicit, or if it suggests a less specific way of translating the text, start it with "This can be translated as…"
      * Put the suggestion in quotes and if there is more than one suggestion, separate them with the word "or."
        * This can be translated as "X" or "Y" or "Z".
  * You may also need to explain the issue, but try to include a translation suggestion.
  * If there is a Translation Academy page that deals with the issue, refer to it by writing, for example, "(See: Metonymy)" or "(See: Exclusive)" at the end of the note. You can see these at [[:en:ta:ta-topics|Topics]].
  * Normally we do not need to write notes for terms that are in the key terms list. However, when a key term has multiple senses, you may need to write a note telling which sense is meant in the text.
  * If you write several translation suggestions and one of them is the UDB, write "(UDB)" immediately after the suggestion.
      * **brings forth that which is good**  - “brings out good things” or “displays good things.” This could also be translated without the metaphor as “lives his life in a good way” or “does good things which show” (UDB).
  * When it is required to give a different meaning than what is found in the ULB, begin the note with "Another possible meaning is '…'" or "Other possible meanings are 1) 'meaning A' or 2) 'meaning B.'"

==== Reasons for translation notes: ====

Here are some reasons for different kinds of translation notes.

  * Neither the ULB nor the UDB gives certain information that translaotrs might need in order to translate the text.
      * who or what a pronoun or demonstrative refers to
      * which meaning is intended for a word that has multiple meanings

  * Translators may need certain information because of the grammar of their language.
      * whether 'you' is singular, dual, or plural
      * whether 'we' includes the audience or not
      * who the actor is in a passive clause

  * Some languages don't have the same syntactic structures that English has or they may use them only for certain purposes. We may need to give suggestions for translating texts that have things like passive clauses, relative clauses, appositions, ellipses, or indirect quotes.

  * Translators may not understand a particular figure of speech and may need some suggestions for how to translate it – particularly if they don't use that kind of figure or would not use it in certain situations.

  * The translators and their readers may not be familiar with the cultures of the Bible, and so may not understand the text because they lack information that the authors left implicit. We may need to explain the implicit information and give suggestions for how they might translate it. (We don't want to add information to the text that the author was not intending to communicate. But if the author must have assumed that the people would have something in mind in order to understand what he was saying, we may need to bring that out.)

  * If a page has a continuing quote, we'll need a note in parentheses like "John continues speaking to the crowd" or "Jesus continues speaking to his disciples" or "Jesus continues telling his parable."

==== List of Important Terms ====

The Important Terms section will have a list of the important terms in the ULB on that page. Each word will be linked to a Key Term page that explains it. Do not write anything in this section. If you think a word should be included, say so in the Discussion section. This page explains how we decide whether a term should have a page: [[:en:bible:team-info:training:topics:kt-yes-no|Is It a Key Term?]]
