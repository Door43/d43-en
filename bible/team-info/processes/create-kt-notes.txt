====== How to Create Notes for Key Term Pages ======


These are some ideas to guide how the notes are created in the Key Term pages:

    * Just below the Facts or Definition heading, write a clear, concise sentence or two that briefly tells about the concept.
    * Use bullet points to tell about the following kinds of things.
      * Different senses of the word
      * Definitions of different forms of the word. (For example, sin, sinner, and sinful.)
      * Translation suggestions for the word, its various senses, and it's various forms.
      * Other names that the person or place is called
      * Up to a few important events in the Bible concerning that person or place
    * When using pronouns to refer to born-again believers, use "they" and "them" rather than "we" and "us".


In the (See also:) section, write next to the word "term" any key terms that would be helpful for understanding this one. These will be changed to links so that the translators can click on the word and go immediately to its page.


Bible References will be generated by tags in the Translation Notes pages. You do not need to write in any references.
