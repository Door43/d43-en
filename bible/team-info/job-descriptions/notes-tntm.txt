===== Learning to Improve Notes =====

      * Those pages will be tagged with “mgr” followed by the three-letter book code. For example, a comment on Matthew would be tagged as “mgrmat”. You can use the Search box to find these occurrences, or use the admin page: [[:en:bible:admin-reports:reviewer-manager-admin|Reviewer to Manager Admin Page]].
      * When you have read and responded to the comment, delete the tag from the page.
