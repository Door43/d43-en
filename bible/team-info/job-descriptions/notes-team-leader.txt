====== Notes Team Leader Responsibilities ======

==== Team Purpose ====

Each Notes team will systematically work through each verse of their assigned book of the Bible and identify the significant issues that may difficulty in translating that verse. The team will address these issues in the following ways:

  * Identify and list Important Terms
  * Write concise, helpful explanatory notes on each word or phrase that is unclear or difficult to translate
  * Identify and correct problems in the UDB and ULB text that hinder clear, accurate translation

All of the content developed will be released as open-source, unrestricted materials. No copyrighted materials should be included in their creation. It is also understood that the team agrees to have the product of their work freely distributed as open-source.
