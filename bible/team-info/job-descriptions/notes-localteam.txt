====== Translation Notes Team Information ======

==== Team Purpose ====

Each Notes Team will work through each verse of their assigned book of the Bible and identify the significant issues that may be difficult in translating that verse. The team will address these issues in the following ways:

  * Identify and list, in order of appearance, in the ULB Important Terms
  * Write concise, helpful explanatory notes on each word or phrase that is unclear or difficult to translate.

All of the content developed will be released as open-source, unrestricted materials. No copyrighted materials should be included in their creation. It is also understood that the team agrees to have the product of their work freely distributed as open-licensed.

  * Follow the schedule set by the Translation Notes Teams Manager to rapidly and conscientiously work through the assigned book.
