 ====== Implicit and Explicit Information ======

===== Description =====

There are two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages. One is called **//explicit//** and the other //**implicit**//. The speaker, or writer, has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.
  * Information that is included in a message is **explicit**,
  * Information that is left out of a message is but is still understood is **implicit**.

===== Template =====

  - **(Required)**  Write the phrase from the ULB in bold that has  the implicit information
  - (Optional) Give a clarifying translation
  - **(Required)**  Identify the content of the implicit information
