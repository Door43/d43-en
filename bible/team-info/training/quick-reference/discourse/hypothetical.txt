====== Hypothetical Situations ======


===== Description =====

Something that is hypothetical is 'assumed' or 'supposed.' A hypothetical situation is a possible scenario from any point in time: past, present or future. This situation may or may not actually be true. It could possibly happen or it may never happen. A hypothetical situation might mean asking a “what if” question. It might be a “suppose” or “if only” statement.
