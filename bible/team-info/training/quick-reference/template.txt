===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Luk 24:16 ===

"But their eyes were prevented from recognizing him."

  * **(1) Their eyes were prevented from recognizing him**  - **(2)**  "Their eyes were kept from recognizing Jesus." **(3)**  The men's ability to recognize Jesus is spoken of as their eyes' ability to recognize him. **(4)**  It can also be translated as "They were kept from recognizing him" or "Something prevented them so they could not recognize him." **(5)**  (See: [[:en:ta:translate:synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
=== Gen 06:08 ===

"But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh."

  * **(1) in the eyes of Yahweh**  - **(3)**  This is metonymy. Though Yahweh does not have physical eyes, he sees. **(4)**  It can be translated as "in Yahweh's sight" or "in Yahweh's thoughts". **(5)**  (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
=== Act 07:43 ===

You accepted the tabernacle of Molech And the star of the god Rephan, And the images that you made to worship them: And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.'

  * **(1) tabernacle of Molech**  - **(3)**  The tabernacle or tent that housed the false god Molech.
