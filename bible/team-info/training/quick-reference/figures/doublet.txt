===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Genesis 22:12 ===

"He said, "Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing that you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.""

  * **(1) Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him**  - **(3)**  Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. God made sure that Abraham would hear and understand him. **(4)** Alternate translation: "Do not hurt the boy in any way." **(5)**  (See: Doublet)

=== Luke 1:71 ===

"He promised to provide for us salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of everyone who hates us."

  * **(1) enemies…everyone who hates us**  - **(3)**  These two phrases  both refer to those who are against God's people. **(4)** Alternate translation: "people who fight against us and want to harm us." **(5)**  (See: Doublet)

=== 2 Thessalonians 1:4 ===

"So we ourselves speak proudly about you among the churches of God concerning your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions that you endure. "

  * **(1) your persecutions and afflictions**  - **(3)**  This says the same thing in different ways to emphasize the how badly they were being treated by their enemies. **(4)** Alternate translation: "your severe persecutions." **(5)**  (See: Doublet)
