====== Simile ======


===== Description =====

In a simile something is compared to something else __of a different kind__ in order to focus on a particular trait that they have in common. The fact that there is a comparison is stated clearly with ‘like’ or ‘as’. 

A simile is different from an ordinary comparison. "The furnace has been broken for a week and now the house is as cold as a refrigerator" is a comparison, but it is not a simile. In both cases the word "cold" is used to refer to very low temperature. 

But "She was as cold as ice" is a simile. Her "cold" emotions are compared to the cold temperature of ice.

=== Gen 22:17 ===

"I will surely bless you and I will greatly multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and your descendants will possess the gate of their enemies."

  * **(1) as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore**  - **(3)** God compared Abraham's descendants to the stars and the sand. Just as people cannot count the huge number of stars or the grains of sand, so there would be so many of Abraham's descendants that people would not be able to count them. **(4)** AT: "beyond what you can count." **(5)** (See: Simile)

=== Luke 22:44 ===

"Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground."

  * **(1) his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground**  - **(3)** The drops of sweat that were falling from Jesus' forehead were described as similar in appearance to large drops of blood. This image gives the impression of great suffering. **(5)** (See: Simile)

=== 2 Timothy 2:16-18 ===

"Avoid profane talk, which leads to more and more godlessness. Their word will spread like gangrene, among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus, men who have wandered from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened, and upsetting the faith of some.

  * **(1) Their word will spread like gangrene** - **(2)** "What they say will spread like an infectious disease." **(3)** Just as gangrene quickly spreads in a person's body and destroys it, what those people were saying would spread from person to person and harm the faith of those who heard it. **(4)** AT: "Their word will spread quickly and cause destruction like gangrene" or "People will quickly hear what they say and be harmed by it." **(5)** (See: Simile)

=== James 1:6 ===

But ask in faith, without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave in the sea, driven by the wind and tossed around. 

  * ** (1) is like a wave in the sea, driven by the wind and tossed around** - **(3)** This compares a person who doubts with the way water moves and keeps changing  direction. **(4)** AT: "is always moving back and forth between belief and unbelief" or "is always changing what he believes.” **(5)** (See: Simile)
