===== Description =====

Litotes is a strong statement made by negative phrases to strengthen a positive meaning (e.g. "You won't be disappointed" means "you will like it").

A statement with double negatives that affirm the positive is a type of Litotes (e.g. "With God nothing is impossible" means "With God all things are possible).
