====== Metaphor ======


===== Description =====

A metaphor is a figure of speech that creates a 'word picture' by relating one thing (the topic of the metaphor) to an unrelated object. Metaphors imply (or state directly) that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. A metaphor transfers an image from one familiar object to another object that is less easily understood.
