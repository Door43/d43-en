====== with my whole heart, with all my heart ======

Description

Depending on the context, the Hebrew word often translated as "heart" can refer to either the mind or the seat of emotions. So when we write notes for expressions involving "heart," we need to look at the context to know if "heart" refers to the mind or the emotions. But it's not always clear.

In some languages, the meaning of "with my whole heart" or "with all my heart" would not be expressed referring with a body part but with an adverb.
