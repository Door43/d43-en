====== Text Variant ======

===== Description =====
This describes how write a note calling attention to a footnote explaining changes between the various ancient manuscripts. 


===== Standard Note =====

When text contains a footnote explaining what portions of text are omitted, the following Transation Note should state the following:

  * **verse [number]**  - This verse was omitted because some of the older, more reliable, ancient texts did not include the verse. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:originalmanuscripts|Original Manuscripts]])

Other cases as they become known will need to be added
  * Case where the text portion was included both small and large sections (see Mark and John)


===== Bible Examples =====

The Ethiopian answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." \f* \v 38 So the Ethiopian commanded the chariot to stop, and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and Philip baptized him.
