====== Text Variant ======

===== Description =====
This describes how to write a note to call the translator's attention to a footnote in the ULB or UDB that explains differences between the various ancient manuscripts. 


===== Standard Note =====

When the ULB or UDB contains a footnote that explains what portions of the text are omitted, the following Transation Note should state the following:

  * **verse [number]**  - This verse was omitted because some of the older, more reliable, ancient texts did not include the verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_textvariants]])
Other cases as they become known will need to be added

  * **verse [number]** - Some early texts have these verses and others do not.
 
===== Bible Examples =====

==== Acts 8:36 ====


==== ULB ====

<usfm> \v 36 As they went on the road, they came to some water; the eunuch said, "Look, there is water here; what prevents me from being baptized?" \v 37 \f + \ft Some ancient authorities add, in whole or in part, v. 37. \fqa Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized." The Ethiopian answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." \f* \v 38 So the Ethiopian commanded the chariot to stop, and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and Philip baptized him.
</usfm>


==== Translation notes: ====

  * **verse 37**  - This verse was omitted because some of the older, more reliable, ancient texts did not include the verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_textvariants]])
