====== Translate Names ======

===== Description =====

Translators may come across many names in the Bible that they are not familiar with. They will need to know what kind of thing they refer to, such as a person, country, landform, a body of water, or something else.

Translators may need to change the spelling of a name so that their readers will be able to pronounce it. They will need to be consistent in the spelling so that their readers will be able to recognize when a name refers to someone they have already read about.

There are other issues that deal with translating names on [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]]. Translators may want to refer to that page when they come across a new name.

===== Template =====

1) If there are many new names in a chunk that are not listed in the Important Terms, simply write the following at the top of the translation notes:\\

(See: Translate Names) \\

This is especially useful in genealogies and other lists of names where there is no need to write notes for each name.

2) If this is the first time a person or place is named in the book and it is not an important term, write a note like this:

  - **(Required)**  Write the name from the ULB in bold
  - (Optional) Give a clarifying translation
  - (Optional) Identify what it is a name for (place, man, woman, spirit, god, etc.) or give information about it.
  - (Optional) Give a translation alternative
  - (Optional) Add TA Link: (See: Translate Names)

  * **(1) ULB text**  - **(3)**  Identify or give info **(5)**  (See: Translate Names)

3) If it is a name that has been not been used in recent chapters or chunks, write a note like this:

  - **(Required)**  Write the name or list the names from the ULB in bold
  - (Optional) Give a clarifying translation
  - (Optional) Identify who or what it refers to
  - (Optional) Give a translation alternative
  - **(Required)**  Refer translators to where they wrote it in an earlier chunk.
  * **(1) ULB text**  - **(3)**  Identify. **(5)**  See how you wrote this in #:#.


===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Gen 23:7-9 ===

Abraham arose and bowed down to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth. He spoke to them, saying, "If you agree that I should bury my dead, then hear me and plead with Ephron, the son of Zohar, for me. Ask him to sell me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns, which is at the end of his field. For the full price let him sell it to me publicly as a property for a burial place."

  * **(1) sons of Heth**  - **(5)**  See how you translated this in 23:3.
  * **(1) Ephron…Zohar**  - **(3)**  These are names of men. **(5)**  (See: How to Translate Names)
  * **(1) the cave of Machpelah**  - **(2)**  “the cave in Machpela.” **(3)**  Machpela was the name of an area or region. Ephron owned a field in Machpela and the cave that was in the field.
