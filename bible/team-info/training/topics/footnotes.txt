====== Footnotes ======

The only footnotes that we will have will be in the ULB indicating grammatical information such as number ('singular', 'dual', 'plural') for pronouns or the command form of verbs, and 'inclusive' or 'exclusive' for first person pronouns (we, us, our). 

People writing the Gateway language translations will need to decide what kinds of grammatical information they need footnoted.
