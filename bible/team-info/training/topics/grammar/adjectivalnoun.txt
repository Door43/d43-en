====== Adjectival Noun ======

An **adjectival noun** is a noun that acts like an adjective and describes another noun. To fully understand this, it is important to first understand what nouns and adjectives are. In short, a **noun** is a person, place or thing. An **adjective** is a word that describes a noun. See the [[en:ta:vocabulary:parts-of-speech]] page for more complete information.  A noun that describes another noun is acting like an adjective and so that is why it is called an "adjectival noun".

===== Examples from English =====

In the example, "Bible teacher" the adjectival noun is "Bible" because it describes the noun "teacher" and tells what kind of teacher it is. Another example of an adjectival noun could be "history" as in "history teacher" or "history lesson". Some languages do not use adjectival nouns and so would have to translate these using a phrase such as, "teacher who teaches the Bible" and, a "lesson about history". Other examples of an adjectival noun describing a noun include: church building; school bus, car door, desk chair and many others.

Note that another adjective may also be combined with an adjectival noun to describe a noun. For example: "yellow school bus" or "comfortable desk chair".

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Gentile descendants - Gentile is a noun (e.g. non-Jewish people). Descendants is also a noun (e.g. offspring). This adjectival noun example means descendants who are Gentile.//** [I couldn't find the phrase "Gentile descendants" in any Bible version I checked]** //

Macedonian believers, Midianite hordes, Israeli camp //** [in these examples, "Macedonian" and "Midianite" and "Israeli" are actually true adjectives so we need to find other Bible examples]** //
===== Translation Suggestions =====

In the first example above, it could be translated 'the descendants of Gentile people.' Likewise, believers of Macedonia would be equal to the second example given. When the adjectival noun portrays 'ownership or belonging', use the noun and change the adjectival noun into an "of …." phrase. Using a possessive form of a noun is another possibility (e.g. Israel's camp) or saying the camp belonging to the Israelites work equally well. Instead of 'church building,, one might say 'the building that belongs to the church.'
