====== Abstract Nouns ======

Remember that **//nouns//** are by definition a person, place, thing or idea. People, places and some things are easy to understand because they can be experienced in the physical world.

Ideas and things like 'contentment' or 'peace' are equally real but not tangible objects. Much of life, much of Scripture, involves experiencing realities that cannot be seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched in a physical sense. **ABSTRACT NOUNS** allow us to express such things.
===== Examples from English =====

  * Some abstract nouns are related to things which can be interacted with physically. For example, the word "child" is a concrete noun. A child is a tangible, touchable being. Childhood, though, is an intangible concept that relates to children. "Childhood" is an //abstract noun//.
  * Another example is 'son.' Son is a concrete noun that describes an individual. "Sonship" is an abstract noun that refers to the essence of the relationship of being a son.
  * Other abstract nouns point directly to concepts, attitudes, emotions or characteristics. Goodness, contentment and justice are examples of those types of abstract nouns.

English uses common word endings (suffixes) that may help identify abstract nouns. They include such endings as:

-tion; -ism; -ity; -ment; -ness; -age; -ance; -ence; -ship; -ability; -acy

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Luke 19:8-10 //Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I will restore four times the amount." 9 Jesus said to him, "Today//** salvation**// has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the people who are lost."//

Salvation is an abstract noun. The phrase, "salvation has come to this house" can be translated with the verb 'save': “God has saved this household.”

===== Translation Suggestions =====

**ABSTRACT NOUNS**  are powerful tools that present unique challenges. Anything abstract is subject to the influence of personal interpretation. It is important to understand the cultural and historical context of abstractions so that the translation conveys the original meaning. Definitions from the source language (e.g. Greek, Aramaic or Hebrew) are a valuable tool. It is also important to be aware of a reader's likely understanding of a concept. In addition to the careful selection of abstract nouns, the use of related concrete nouns helps to make the meaning clear.
