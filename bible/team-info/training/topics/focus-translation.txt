====== Translation Focus ======


Bill Clinton essentially won a US presidential election by continually telling his team that, "It's the economy, stupid!" That may seem offensive, but it did focus them on the main issue. And he was elected.


**“****It's the translatio****n…”** That should be the motto of this project. The purpose of this project is to help people with no other preparation to translate the Bible accurately into their mother tongue. Period. The end. That's all.


We know that many of you have wonderful skill in evangelism, teaching, preaching, etc. When you see some of these verses or key terms, you could wax eloquent for hours about the spiritual wonders that it evokes! Please don't. At least, not in the pages of this project.


All we need from you is the key information that will help translators select the best words or phrases to communicate the author's intended meaning of the verse that they are translating.


    * We do not want you to correct or guide their theology.
    * We do not want you to fix their devotional life.
    * We do not want you to present them with a suggested outline for their Sunday sermon.


We need you to keep a laser focus on the singular purpose of accurately translating the words and phrase in the text.


    * Put in everything that is necessary to do that.
    * Throw out everything that is not helpful to that process.


If you can't explain clearly why a **translator**  would need to know something in order to **translate**, don't include it.


We know it is hard, but we are confident that you can do it. They are counting on you to give them the help they need, and not to clutter it up their tiny mobile phone screen with things that don't help them translate.
