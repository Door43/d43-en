====== Review of the Materials ======

When using a "crowd-sourced" approach to the development of content, it is necessary to understand the strengths and the limitations of that process. The strengths include:

  * a large number of people can participate
  * the crowd can work anytime and anywhere at their discretion
  * a large volume of content can be produced very quickly 

We are using this approach specifically because of these strengths. However, we know that the weaknesses of the crowd approach include:

  * it is messy to administer
  * the crowd may not be able to reach consensus on all points
  * the content may not be completely accurate, depending on "who had it last"

To accommodate the fact that the crowd is difficult to administer, we work harder! And to overcome the other weaknesses, we have developed a multi-layered review process. We view the results of the work of a team as a **draft**. After the team has finished creating the draft, it is reviewed by the team leaders, then by the project manager, and finally by the project editor. During these three levels of review, we do the following:

   * check for accuracy
   * check grammar, punctuation and spelling
   * check that the level of language is appropriate
   * verify that the content is directly related to translation of the text, and not to wider issues
   * resolve any issues where there is not consensus in the Discussions

As a result of this process, we are confident that we are producing notes that will be effective in helping people accurately translate the Bible into their own heart languages.
