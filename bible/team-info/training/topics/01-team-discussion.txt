====== Current Notes Team Discussions ======

The links on this page go to current, active discussion topics that relate to all of the notes teams. The purpose of these pages is to work through current problems and issues related to creating notes. When resolved, many of these discussions will become independent Notes 201 topics. 

If there is a topic that you team is actively discussing which is not on the list, and which affects all teams, please contact your team leader about adding it to the list.
