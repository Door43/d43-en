====== Use Complete Sentences ======


When creating the Translation Notes, always use complete sentences. Partial sentences or phrases are difficult to translate into the "gateway" languages. All notes should begin with a capital letter, contain a complete thought, an end with normal sentence punctuation. 


==== KT Notes ====

For example, a KT note should not be:

  * a river on the east side of Israel

But rather:

  * The Jordan River is located on the east side of Israel.


==== Translation Notes ====


For example, a Translation note should not be:


    * **show yourself**  - Or, “I command you to show yourself”
But rather:


    * **show yourself**  - This may also be translated as, “I command you to show yourself.”
