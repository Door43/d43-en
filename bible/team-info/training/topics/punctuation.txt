====== Punctuation ======

We have decided to use "American-style" punctuation. For this project, that means:

  * Final punctuation should be included inside the quotation marks. (Ex. He said, "What are you doing?")
  * Use a comma before the "and" in a string of items. (Ex. the length, height, and depth of the box.)
  * Use a colon between the chapter and verse on a Bible reference (Luke 1:2-5)
  * Add double-quotation marks for direct speech, and single-quotation marks for quotations within quotations.
  * When referring to a term in a note, add double-quotes around the term to set it off from the other text (Ex. The meaning of "grace" is…).
  * When writing a string of translation alternatives separated by "or" do not use commas between the phrases. (Ex. That is, "one time" or "the next" or "all at once.")
  * Do not a comma when introducing a note with "This can also be translated as …"
