====== When to Use the Discussion Section ======


Every member of each team has the right to edit directly in the content of the page they are working on. Some may wonder if they should, or whether to add a comment to the Discussion section instead.


You were chosen for this project because we trust your professional understanding of the topic. Therefore, we trust you to make the changes that you believe need to be made. Furthermore, we **prefer** that you make those changes directly into the content of the page so that the reviewer does not have to do the additional work of adding it in later. If you know how to make the content of the page better, please do!


That said, there are a few cases when you should use the Discussion section instead. These include:


    * You think something should be changed, but you can't figure out exactly how. Don't agonize over it. Just post a comment in the Discussion to alert other team members who may solve it easily.
    * Something is wrong, but it is not your area of expertise. Don't mess with the content, but do post your concerns in the Discussion for others to consider.
    * You are afraid that if you change something that someone else has written, they may not like it or agree with you. Post your idea in the Discussion section instead.
    * You added content to the page, and someone else changed it in a way that you thinks detracts from, instead of improves it. Do not just change it back and hope you "have it last." Instead, post a comment in the Discussion as to why you think it should be your original, or other, content. This will allow the team to weigh in, and the reviewed to decide which content should be in the final page.


Finally, there is one final, important use of the Discussion area. If you believe that the page you are working on is ready for final review, please post a comment to that effect so that the other team members can agree or not, and so the team leader can consider removing the page from draft status so the team can focus on the pages that still need help.
