====== K.I.S.S. ======


We all know what this means: Keep it simple, stupid. A crude, but effective phrase.


It is extremely important that all of the materials we are creating be very simple and easy to understand. We believe we can accomplish this and still have them be accurate. In fact, we believe that if they are not simple, they will not be accurate. Why is that?


    * All of our materials that you are so carefully writing will be translated into 40-50 "gateway" or "trade" languages. The people who translate them will be native speakers of the gateway language, not of English. If your content is not simple for them to understand, it may not be translated accurately.
    * The end-user of your content will be native speakers of languages into which the Bible is not yet translated. Therefore, the gateway language that they use will not be their mother tongue–it will be a foreign language that they also know. If the content is not simple, they will not understand it and their translation will not be accurate.


Therefore, although it may seem counter-intuitive, simple really will be much more accurate for this project.
