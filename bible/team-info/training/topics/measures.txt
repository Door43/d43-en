====== Measures, Weights, Distances ======


==== Metric or US? ====

In general, whenever we write in our notes about a measure, weight or distance, we will use the metric system rather than the US system. The reason for this is so that as our notes are translated into other languages, almost all of which use the metric system, we will not burden them with doing the mathematical conversion. 


==== Biblical Terms ====

The ULB (literal) text for the Bible will use the original biblical terms (cubit, stadia, denarius, etc.). Our purpose is to carry through to the translator a sense of the way that the OT and NT cultures viewed the measures.

The UDB (dynamic) version will convert these in most cases to the metric equivalent. This is a partial list of biblical terms followed by the suggested metric equivalent for the UDB: (in progress)

  * cubit - half a meter
  * span - 
  * stadia - 
  * denarius - 
  * shekel - 
  *  


==== Term in Our Notes ====

All biblical weights, distances and measures will be listed as key terms, and explained on those pages. Therefore, it is not necessary to explain them in each occurrence in the Bible text. However, if they have a special significance in a passage, it may be necessary to add a note to explain that. 

When we refer to a biblical term from the ULB, we will use the biblical terms when discussing it in the notes. However, it may be helpful on a case-by-case basis to add translation alternatives that use the metric equivalents in the notes.
