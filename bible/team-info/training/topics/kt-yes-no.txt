====== Is It a Key Term? ======

Why are some terms labeled as key terms, and other are not? This decision is made by the Notes teams, and is actually more art than science. To become a Key Term, a word or phrase should have these characteristics:

  - it is biblically or theologically significant
  - it needs more than a sentence or two in the notes to explain how to translate it accurately
  - it appears often in the Bible, so it is more efficient to link to another page than to keep repeating the explanation in the notes

If a word has a simple definition that an average speaker would be expected to know from a dictionary, it should not be a Key Term.

If you want to find out if a word is already a key term, see [[:en:bible:admin-reports:00-key-term-full-list|Key Terms List]].
