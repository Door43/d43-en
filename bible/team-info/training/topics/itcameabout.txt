====== Translation Notes for "It came about" ======

The Greek phrases //kai egeneto// and //egento de// are discourse markers. In English they are often translated as "It happened that" or "It came about that." The translators probably will not be able to translate those phrases literally. So we will need to write notes explaining what they mean.

Since //kai egeneto// and //egeneto de// have multiple functions, we will need to write context specific notes such as the following. (The parts that distinguish one note from another are underlined here.) These are the uses that JoAnn Marie Gault described for Luke and Acts. Other authors in the Bible might have used them differently.

   * **It came about that**  - This phrase is used here to mark __the beginning of a new part of the story__. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **It came about that**  - This phrase is used here to mark __where the action starts__. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **It came about that**  - This phrase is used here to mark __an important event in the story__. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
At first, the MTTs might not know what to do with this information. But after a while, they might realize that in their language they would do something special at each of those points in a narrative, such as putting in a certain word, or changing the word order, clause type, or aspect marking.

(Hopefully the text team will not translate these Greek markers as "It happened that," because it could be understood as connoting "happenstance", which is something the Greek expressions do not connote.)
