====== Phase 2 Issues ======

This is a list of general issues that we want to deal with in Phase 2. This list might get long. Let's list the issues in alphabetical order.

  * **Connecting Statements** - Make sure that the wording is consistent in each book. (In the Ezekiel notes, there is variation between "the Spirit", "Yahweh" and "God.")

  * **Doublets** - Do we really want to encourage translators to simply use one of them? How do we decide when that is acceptable or when too much information would be lost?

  * **Important Terms** - Change "There are no important terms for these verses" to "There are no new important terms for these verses." Sometimes there are important terms in the ULB, but they are not listed on every chunk because they are used so much in that chapter or book.

  * **Narrative Present in Notes** - The example below shows why I do not want to use the narrative present in notes.
    * **When you have lifted up** - “when you lift up.” This __has not__ happened yet. \\  (This had not happened at the time Jesus was saying it, but it did happen since then. So  that no one would mistake us for saying that it has not happened yet in our time, we changed the comment to "This __had not__ happened yet," even though the rest of the comments use the narrative present.)

  * **Punctuation in TNs** - Reconsider use of question marks 
    * In your greatness, who are you like? - “Who is as great as you are?” ...

  * **Symbolic acts** - Do we want a standard note format for these? Sometimes only the symbolic act is mentioned. They're not just idioms, but I don't think they're simply metonymy either.
      * **will shake his fist at them** - "will threaten them"??

  * **tA Links** - We have not been putting the same tA links on multiple notes in a chunk, but when the issue comes up a second time in a chunk, how do we indicate that a second or third note phrase has that issue? See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:10:26]] where there are three notes that involve metonymy.

  * **Tense in prophecy** - What do we do when English versions translate it with the past tense, but it refers to things in the future?

  * **Yahweh** - The ULB uses "Yahweh." Some believers find that startling, perhaps even offensive. Would we want to avoid using God's name in the connecting statements?
