====== ULB Text Edit Training ======


When you joined the a team that is editing the "literal" ULB source text for the Bible Translation Notes project, you received a brief Skype orientation to the project. We believe that rather than "front-loading" you with a lot of instruction and information, it is better for you to start working on the text with the other team members, and then to answer the questions that arise from your involvement in the project. The resources on this page are designed to provide additional training you will need and the answers to the other questions that you may have.
