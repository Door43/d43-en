\v 1 Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled.
\v 2 This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
\v 3 And all went to enrol themselves, every one to his own city.
\v 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called
Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;
\v 5 to enrol himself with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with child.
\v 6 And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered.
\v 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there
was no room for them in the inn.
\p
\v 8 And there were shepherds in the same country living in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
\v 9 And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
\v 10 And the angel said to them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the
people:
\v 11 for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.
\v 12 And this \add is\add* the sign to you: You shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.
\v 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
\q
\v 14 Glory to God in the highest,
\q And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.
\m
\v 15 And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
even to Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.
\v 16 And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.
\v 17 And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
\v 18 And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.
\v 19 But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
\v 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was
spoken to them.
\p
\v 21 And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called JESUS, which was so called by the angel
before he was conceived in the womb.
\p
\v 22 And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem,
to present him to the Lord
\v 23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),
\v 24 and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young
pigeons.
\v 25 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the
consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
\v 26 And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
\v 27 And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning
him after the custom of the law,
\v 28 then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
\q
\v 29 Now lettest you your servant depart, Lord,
\q According to your word, in peace;
\q
\v 30 For mine eyes have seen your salvation,
\q
\v 31 Which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
\q
\v 32 A light for revelation to the Gentiles,
\q And the glory of your people Israel.
\m
\v 33 And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him;
\v 34 and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this
\add child\add* is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against;
\v 35 yes and a sword shall pierce through your own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.
\v 36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having
lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
\v 37 and she had been a widow even to fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings
and supplications night and day.
\v 38 And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all them that were looking for the
redemption of Jerusalem.
\v 39 And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to
their own city Nazareth.
\p
\v 40 And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
\p
\v 41 And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
\v 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast;
\v 43 and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents
knew it not;
\v 44 but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and
acquaintance:
\v 45 and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.
\v 46 And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing
them, and asking them questions:
\v 47 and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
\v 48 And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, Son, why have you thus dealt with us? behold,
your father and I sought you sorrowing.
\v 49 And he said to them, How is it that you sought me? knew you not that I must be in my Father’s house?
\v 50 And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them.
\v 51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject to them: and his mother kept all
\add these\add* sayings in her heart.
\p
\v 52 And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
