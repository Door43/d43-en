\v 1 Now it came to pass on a sabbath, that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked the ears, and did
eat, rubbing them in their hands.
\v 2 But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do you that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day?
\v 3 And Jesus answering them said, Have you not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and they that were with
him;
\v 4 how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it
is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone?
\v 5 And he said to them, The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
\p
\v 6 And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his
right hand was withered.
\v 7 And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse
him.
\v 8 But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And
he arose and stood forth.
\v 9 And Jesus said to them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy
it?
\v 10 And he looked round about on them all, and said to him, Stretch forth your hand. And he did
\add so\add*: and his hand was restored.
\v 11 But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
\p
\v 12 And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to
God.
\v 13 And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles:
\v 14 Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
\v 15 and Matthew and Thomas, and James \add the son\add* of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,
\v 16 and Judas \add the son\add* of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor;
\v 17 and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the
people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their
diseases;
\v 18 and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.
\v 19 And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed
\add them\add* all.
\p
\v 20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed
\add are\add* you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
\v 21 Blessed \add are\add* you that hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed
\add are\add* you that weep now: for you shall laugh.
\v 22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you
\add from their company\add*, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.
\v 23 Rejoice in that day, and leap \add for joy\add*: for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did
their fathers to the prophets.
\v 24 But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.
\v 25 Woe to you, you that are full now! for you shall hunger. Woe
\add to you\add*, you that laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.
\v 26 Woe \add to you\add*, when all men shall speak well of you! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false
prophets.
\p
\v 27 But I say to you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,
\v 28 bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.
\v 29 To him that smiteth you on the \add one\add* cheek offer also the other; and from him that takes away your cloak
withhold not your coat also.
\v 30 Give to every one that asks thee; and of him that takes away your goods ask them not again.
\v 31 And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them likewise.
\v 32 And if you love them that love you, what thank have you? for even sinners love those that love them.
\v 33 And if you do good to them that do good to you, what thank have you? for even sinners do the same.
\v 34 And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thank have you? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as
much.
\v 35 But love your enemies, and do \add them\add* good, and lend, never despairing; and your reward shall be great, and you
shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
\v 36 Be you merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
\v 37 And judge not, and you shall not be judged: and condemn not, and you shall not be condemned: release, and you shall be
released:
\v 38 give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into
your bosom. For with what measure you mete it shall be measured to you again.
\p
\v 39 And he spoke also a parable to them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?
\v 40 The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher.
\v 41 And why behold you the mote that is in your brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in your own eye?
\v 42 Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in your eye, when you yourself behold
not the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye, and then shall you see
clearly to cast out the mote that is in your brother’s eye.
\v 43 For there is no good tree that brings forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that brings forth good fruit.
\v 44 For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
\v 45 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and the evil
\add man\add* out of the evil \add treasure \add* brings forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his
mouth speaketh.
\p
\v 46 And why call you me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
\v 47 Every one that comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:
\v 48 he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose,
the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well builded.
\v 49 But he that heareth, and does not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which
the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.
