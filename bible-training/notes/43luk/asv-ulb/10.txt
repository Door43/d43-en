\v 1 Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and
place, whither he himself was about to come.
\v 2 And he said to them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray you therefore the Lord of the
harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.
\v 3 Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.
\v 4 Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way.
\v 5 And into whatever house you shall enter, first say, Peace \add be
\add* to this house.
\v 6 And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again.
\v 7 And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not
from house to house.
\v 8 And into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:
\v 9 and heal the sick that are therein, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come near to you.
\v 10 But into whatever city you shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say,
\v 11 Even the dust from your city, that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the
kingdom of God is come nigh.
\v 12 I say to you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
\v 13 Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were
done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.
\v 15 And you, Capernaum, shall you be exalted to heaven? you shall be brought down to Hades.
\v 16 He that hears you hears me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent
me.
\p
\v 17 And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.
\v 18 And he said to them, I [*]saw Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.
\v 19 Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing
shall in any wise hurt you.
\v 20 Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in
heaven.
\p
\v 21 In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you
did hide these things from the wise and understanding, and did reveal them to babes: yea, Father; for so it was
well-pleasing in your sight.
\v 22 All things have been delivered to me of my Father: and no one knows who the Son is, save the Father; and who the
Father is, save the Son, and he to whoever the Son willeth to reveal
\add him\add*.
\v 23 And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed \add are
\add* the eyous which see the things that you see:
\v 24 for I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and saw them not; and to hear
the things which you hear, and heard them not.
\p
\v 25 And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
\v 26 And he said to him, What is written in the law? how read thou?
\v 27 And he answering said, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your
strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.
\v 28 And he said to him, You have answered right: this do, and you shall live.
\v 29 But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
\v 30 Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both
stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
\v 31 And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
\v 32 And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
\v 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,
\v 34 and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on \add them
\add* oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
\v 35 And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatever you
spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.
\v 36 Which of these three, think thou, proved neighbor to him that fell among the robbers?
\v 37 And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said to him, Go, and do you likewise.
\p
\v 38 Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her
house.
\v 39 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet, and heard his word.
\v 40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister did
leave me to serve alone? command her therefore that she help me.
\v 41 But the Lord answered and said to her, Mareha, Mareha, you are anxious and troubled about many things:
\v 42 but one thing is needful: for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
