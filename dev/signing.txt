====== Signing Overview ======

This is the Digital Signature specification for unfoldingWord content.

Overview of digital signatures {{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature#mediaviewer/File:Digital_Signature_diagram.svg|Digital_signature}}

Keys will be generated using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm|ECDSA ]]. And signatures will be hashed with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithm|SHA384]].

====== Definitions ======

  * **Certificate Authority (CA)**  - The organization that authorizes and verifies the existence of valid Signing Entities. See the wiki on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority|Certificate Authority]] for a detailed explanation.
  * **Signing Organization (SO)**  - An organization or individual that has opted to become a Signing Entity.
  * **Signing Entity (SE)**  - A Signing Organization that has been authorized by the Certificate Authority to sign content.
  * **Signing Identity (SI)**  - The digital representation of the Signing Entity that will be distributed for the purpose of verifying the existence of the related Signing Entity.
====== Specification ======

Draft 2.

This specification provides details to the process used for verifying approval by known authorities known as Signing Entities.

===== Preparation =====

A Certificate Authority (unfoldingWord) shall provide a private and public key pair. The public key otherwise known as the CA root certificate shall be publicly and easily available in addition to being distributed with apps needing to verify signed content, while the private key shall remain private and secure on the server.

===== Creating A Signing Entity =====

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>A member of the signing organization shall visit unfoldingword.org and submit a request to register as a new Signing Entity. Information gathered shall include, but not be limited to organization name and contact details. NOTE: if desired the signing organization may provide a public key along with their request. In this case the signing organization shall generate their own private and public key pairs for which they are responsible to keep secure.</font>

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Upon request approval, if no public key was provided by the signing organization, a new public and private key pair shall be generated and issued to the signing organization and thus establish the signing organization as a new Signing Entity (SE). The SE public key and organization information shall be signed by the CA Private Key to return the intermediate certificate which verifies the Signing Identity against the Certificate Authority. The combination of the SE public key, SE organization information, and intermediate certificate shall be known as as the  ** Signing Identity  ** and will serve to identify the signing organization as a valid SE. See Signing Identity Format for details.</font>

===== Signing Content =====

There are two ways in which content may be signed. If the Signing Entity manages it's own keys they will be responsible for fulfilling the following steps. Otherwise the following steps will be performed with the CA.

A hash of the content will be generated according to some pre-determined algorithm. T<font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>he SE private key will then be used to create a signature from this hash.</font>

Signatures of content will be listed in a .sig file. For example, obs-en.json would have its signatures like this:

<code>
location: https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/txt/1/en/obs-en.sig
content:
[
  { "si": "uW",
    "sig": "MGQCMFnYGwvUpx2aB4qs/ODuHzcOej8UuYO8gH778eh8B+tK/YLBQn7P7ZnhGeEbYYhxqAIwFFoTJUjsA7ywKvJtG36n6EN/nubgH2G0XEOLLteR4ylD4+m7hyaiXyphLkP+M/Vv"
  }
]
</code>

Note that the signatures are base64 encoded.

===== Distributing Signed Content =====

<font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>For best results the signed content will be submitted to unfoldingword.org where it will be verified and queued for release via the mobile API. The signed content may also be side loaded onto any supporting app where it will be verified and available for use.</font>

===== Further Notes =====

All content released on unfoldingword.org will be signed by the CA. In addition this content may be signed by an unlimited number of SE.

The status of the content validation will be easily understood by some indicator while viewing the content. Validation information should be displayed when clicking on this indicator.

<font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>For each signature on the content, details of the Signing identity, including name, will be available for viewing.</font>

===== Signing Identity Format =====

SI's for the CA and SE's will include 3 parts: the PEM encoded SE public key, the base64<font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>encoded</font>    SE organizational information, and the signature of the first 2 parts (without comments or newlines, and base64 encoded). An example:

<code>
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MHYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEACIDYgAESwmkZ0AJIQo9cELigBaEPaVbQYnWOWhq
ouunp1AGWSgv+KvV/RS9AiRAMjgr4robcgxDjjrdrESyCiTbRehl1yGT0NxfkGhp
qkjQDUV4/4UH63jfRO3F6d1DtBvrxXJp
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
-----BEGIN ORG INFO-----

dEjO/wIwUQEkCsQmbJS+JR9Y833qMuyAEttBAqF4ZLzWLgbWZSvLEGO6ac2lxTSP
vYjGjsuU
-----END SIG-----
</code>

In the above example, the organizational information decodes to:

<code>
  {
    "created": "2015-02-18",
    "email": "admin@unfoldingword.org",
    "expires": "2025-02-18",
    "modified": "2015-02-18",
    "org": "unfoldingWord",
    "slug": "uW",
    "web": "https://unfoldingword.org"
  }
</code>

===== Certificate Authority Signing Identity Endpoint =====

The CA SI contains the unfoldingWord public key and only differs from normal SI's in that the included signature is not an intermediate certificate, but a direct certificate.

<code>
  location: https://pki.unfoldingword.org/uW-vk.pem
  location: https://pki.unfoldingword.org/uW-vk.pem.sig
</code>

===== Signing Identity Endpoint =====

A list of Signing Identities (SI) and will be available at:

<code>
  location: https://pki.unfoldingword.org/si_catalog.json
  content:
  [
    {
      "slug": "WA",
      "si": "https://pki.unfoldingword.org/si/WA.pem",
      "sigs": [
        "https://pki.unfoldingword.org/si/WA.pem.sig-uW"
        ]
    },
    ...
  ]
</code>

The "sigs" key will always include at least the signature of the uW root, it may also include signatures from other SIs that have cross signed the current organization.

The format of the SI public verification key follows the Public Key Format example listed above.

Once an application has downloaded information for a SI the app can verify the identification information with the SI's verification key, the uW root verification key, and the verification keys of any other organization that has crossed signed this SI. Subsequently, the app can verify content that has been signed by this SI with the SI's verification key.
