===== What Needs To Be Translated =====

Our goal is to see Biblical content in every language of the world! Ultimately, we want the Bible translated into every language. But a Bible translation can take decades. In the mean time, we encourage Christians to translate Open Bible Stories so that they can have some solid Biblical content while the Bible translation is being completed. 

In an attempt to provide all of the tools necessary so that anybody can translate Biblical content into their own language we have developed the [[gateway-languages-strategy|Gateway Langauges Strategy]]. The content that needs to be translated depends on whether or not the language is considered a Gateway Language.
