==== Sharing Unpublished Content from translationStudio ====

Sharing unpublished content that is contained on translationStudio is easy. See [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_share]].

==== Sharing Unpublished Content from Door43 ====

If someone has access to the internet, simply send them the link and they will be able to access the content online. 

To share the content offline, 

   * Log in to Door43
   * Go to the page you want to share
   * On the right-hand side, click on the icon of a page with birds on it for a .odt file, or click on the icon underneath that for a .pdf download. 
   * These files can be merged to create a resource and shared as desired. 

In addition to this, 

   * At the bottom right of each page are three export buttons:
       * TXT - exports the page as a .txt file
       * HTM - exports the page as a .html file
       * ODT - exports the page as a .odt file
   * These files can be merged to create a resource and shared as desired.
