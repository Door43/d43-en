==== Choosing a Translation Platform ====

Now you need to select a translation and checking platform. This is where the translation and checking teams will do their work. There are several options: 

//Please note that not all resources are supported for translation in all platforms! To see which resources are supported on which platform, please visit https://unfoldingword.org/dashboard/ .//

  * **Online in a web browser** - For those with consistent internet, they can work straight on door43. To set up Door43, see [[en:ta:vol1:process:setup_door43]].
  * **Offline on a mobile device** - For those with access to an Android tablet or mobile device, they can work offline in our translation app called translationStudio. To set up translationStudio for Android see [[en:ta:vol1:process:setup_tsandroid]].
  * **Offline on a computer**
    * **In a translation program** - translationStudio-Desktop is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. To set up translationStudio for Desktop see [[en:ta:vol1:process:setup_tsdesktop]]
    * **In a word processor** - For those who would like to work in a word processor, they download the templates needed to do that. To set up a word processor see [[en:ta:vol1:process:setup_word]].

//Remember: Bible translations must be done in USFM and everything else in either DokuWiki or Markdown format. See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:file_formats]].//
