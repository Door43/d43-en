==== Welcome ====

The Process Manual is a practical guide to help translation teams know what steps need to be taken from start to finish and how those steps are to be taken. While the Translation Manual is a how-to guide for translation theory and the Checking Manual is a how-to guide for checking theory and the Technology Manual is a how-to guide for using certain technology pieces, the Process Manual seeks to give a step-by-step process the translation team can follow. The Process Manual guides the translation team from initial setup to final publishing of translated and checked content.
