===== Training Before Translation Begins =====

This module answers the question: What should I know about translation before I start?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_process|The Translation Process]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_why|Why We Translate the Bible]]

It is recommended that you consult the [[en:ta:vol1:translate:toc_transvol1_2|Translation Manual]] frequently as you translate this content. Before you start translating, we recommend that you start working your way through the Translation Manual at least until you know the difference between a literal translation and a meaning-based translation. Much of the rest of the Translation Manual can be used as a "just-in-time" learning resource.

There are many decisions that you must make in agreement with the language community about how to write your language before you begin translating. Please see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:writing_decisions|writing decisions]].




Next we recommend you learn about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:writing_decisions|Decisions for Writing Your Language]]
