===== Translating in a Word Processor =====

This module answers the question: How can I translate in a Word Processor?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:process:pretranslation_training|Training Before Translation Begins]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:process:setup_word|Setting Up a Word Processor]]

==== Using Translation Helps ====

  - Once the source text is set up on your word processor (see  [[en:ta:vol1:process:setup_word]]), then you are ready to start translating. 
    * It is strongly recommended that you consult the translationNotes and translationWords while doing your translation
  - The best way to use the translationNotes and translationWords is to have that file opened in another window so that they can be quickly and easily referenced while the translation is ongoing.

==== Changing a page ====

  * It is recommended that you keep a copy of the source text so that the translation can be compared against the original. This can be done in one of two ways: 
    * Put the translation above (or below) the source language but not deleting the source text. (Note: The source text will have to be deleted before uploading.)
    * Make an extra copy of the source text, then delete the source text from the one copy after the translation has been made. When reference to the source text needs to be made, the other copy with the source text can be referenced. 

==== Saving My Work ====

  * Be sure you save your work frequently to avoid losing your work. 

==== Sharing Your Work ==== 

  * These files can be printed, emailed, or otherwise shared so others can be involved in the translation and checking process. 

==== After Translating in a Word Processor ====

  - We strongly recommend that your translation be checked. See [[en:ta:vol1:process:prechecking_training]].
  - Once the checking is complete (to any level), you may upload your work. 
    - This feature is presently automated for Open Bible Stories. Please follow the instructions on [[:obs-upload]]. 
    - Please contact the Helpdesk if you have any questions. See [[en:ta:vol1:intro:finding_answers]]
  - Once uploaded, you will need to merge your work into Door43. See  [[en:ta:vol1:process:upload_merge]]



Next we recommend you learn about:
