==== Publishing Overview ====

Once a translation has been checked to at least Level 1, it becomes eligible to be published. Published content is placed on a platform where it remains static. While the content on Door43 can change frequently, the published content is static (until it is republished) and assurance of quality remains high. 

When content is published, a copy of what is found on Door43 is published to the unfoldingWord catalogue. From the catalogue (https://api.unfoldingword.org ), is made available in several ways:

   * On the website (https://unfoldingword.org )
    * for online viewing (see https://unfoldingword.org/stories/ and https://unfoldingword.org/bible/ )
    * for download in as PDF for Print-on-Demand
    * for download in multimedia (when available)
   * On the free unfoldingWord mobile app for offline consumption (see https://unfoldingword.org/app/ ).

==== Publishable Content ====

Presently, there are two text resources that can be published using the unfoldingWord publishing engine: 

   * [[en:obs]] - is published at https://unfoldingword.org/stories/
   * [[en:bible:intro]] - is published at https://bible.unfoldingword.org/ as well as on the language page

Capacity is being built to be able to handle multimedia formats as well:

   * Audio Recordings
   * Video Open Bible Stories - available on YouTube and for download at www.openbiblestories.com
   * Audio Bible

==== Published Content ====

In Door43, a brief statement will appear in resources that may be eligible for publishing which states the status of publishing in that namespace. For instance, at the time of writing the [[en:obs]] in English says "This resource is published on unfoldingWord as checking level 3 and version 4. See it at https://unfoldingword.org/stories."
