==== Publishing Overview ====

There are two translation platforms that we use - translationStudio and Door43. Once translations have been completed, we encourage these translations to be checked. Once a translation has been checked to at least Level 1, it becomes eligible to be published. Published content is placed on a platform where it remains static. While the content on Door43 can change frequently, the published content is static and assurance of quality remains high. 

When content is published, a copy of what is found on Door43 is published to the [[https://unfoldingword.org/stories|unfoldingWord website]] in several formats:

   * To be viewed online
   * In a print-ready PDF for Print-on-Demand
   * On the free [[https://unfoldingword.org/app|unfoldingWord mobile app]] for offline consumption

==== Publishable Content ====

Presently, there are two text resources that can be published using the unfoldingWord publishing engine: 

   * [[en:obs|Open Bible Stories]]
   * [[en:bible:intro|the Bible]]

Capacity is being built to be able to handle multimedia formats as well:

   * Audio Open Bible Stories
   * Video Open Bible Stories
   * Audio Bible

==== Published Content ====

Published content can be found at https://unfoldingword.org/stories/ and on the [[https://unfoldingword.org/app|unfoldingWord mobile app]]. 

In Door43, a brief statement will appear in resources that may be eligible for publishing which states the status of publishing in that namespace. For instance, at the time of writing the [[en:obs|Open Bible Stories in English]] says "This resource is published on unfoldingWord as checking level 3 and version 4. See it at https://unfoldingword.org/stories."
