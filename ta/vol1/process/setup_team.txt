==== Choosing a Team ====

As you begin selecting a translation and checking team, there are many different types of people and roles that are needed. There are also specific qualifications that are needed for each team. 
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:choose_team]] - Describes many of the roles that are needed
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:qualifications]] - Describes some of the skills needed by the translators
  * Remember that everyone on the team needs to sign a statement that they agree with (forms are available at https://unfoldingword.org/forms/ ): 
    * [[en:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith]]
    * [[en:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines]]
    * [[en:ta:vol1:intro:open_license]]
  * Everyone on the team also needs to know the qualities of a good translation (see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_intro]]). 
  * The team will also need to know where they can find answers (see [[en:ta:vol1:intro:finding_answers]]). 

==== Translation Decisions ====

There are many decisions the translation team will have to make, many of them right at the beginning of the project. Included are the following:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translation_difficulty]] - Choosing what to translate first is another decision to be made
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_text]] - Choosing a good source text is very important
    * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_licensing]] - Copyright issues must be considered when choosing a source text
    * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_version]] - Translating from the latest version of a source text is best
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_alphabet]] - Many languages have alphabet decisions that need to be made
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:writing_decisions]] - Writing style, punctuation, translating names, spelling, and other decisions have to be made
