==== Translation Teams and the Definition of a Good Translation ====

There are many important questions that must be considered when setting up a translation and checking team. Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that the goal is a [[en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_intro|good translation]] which has four basic characteristics:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_clear|Clear]] - Clear translations can only be produced by including native-speakers of the target language, preferably many of them, as translators and checkers
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_natural|Natural]] - Natural translations can only be produced by including native-speakers of the target language, preferably many of them, as translators and checkers
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_accurate|Accurate]] - Accurate translations can only be produced by people who understand well the language of the source text and notes and preferably the original text, too
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_church_approved|Church-Approved]] - Church-Approved translations are most easily produced by including in the translation and checking process as many church networks who speak the target language as possible

==== Choosing a Team ====

As you begin selecting a translation and checking team, there are many different types of people and roles that are needed. There are also specific qualifications that are needed for each team. 
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:choose_team]] - Describes many of the roles that are needed
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:qualifications]] - Describes some of the skills needed by the translators

==== Translation Decisions ====

There are many decisions the translation team will have to make, many of them right at the beginning of the project. Included are the following:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_text]] - Choosing a good source text is very important
    * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_licensing]] - Copyright issues must be considered when choosing a source text
    * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_version]] - Translating from the latest version of a source text is best
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_alphabet]] - Many languages have alphabet decisions that need to be made
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:writing_decisions]] - Writing style, punctuation, translating names, spelling, and other decisions have to be made
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_what]] - Choosing what to translate first is another decision to be made
