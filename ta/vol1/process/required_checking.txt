==== Purpose of Checking Levels ====

The purpose the Checking Levels (see [[en:ta:vol1:checking:toc_checkvol1_2]]) is primarily to help ensure that the translation has been made in accordance with the [[en:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith]] and the [[en:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines]]. Another purpose for the checking levels is to increase the input and ownership of the community that will be using it. 

=== Checking Level 1 ===

Checking Level 1 is done primarily by the translation team, with some input from the language community. See [[en:ta:vol1:checking:level1]].

After completing the Level 1 Check, you are encouraged to publish (see [[en:ta:vol1:process:intro_publishing]]) your translation and continue on to Checking Level 2 (see below). 

=== Checking Level 2 ===

Checking Level 2 is done to verify that representative groups from the local language community agree that the translation is a good one (see [[en:ta:vol1:checking:level2]]). It is done with a language community check (see [[en:ta:vol1:checking:language_community_check]]) and a church leader check (see [[en:ta:vol1:checking:church_leader_check]]). 

After completing the Level 2 Check, you are encouraged to publish (see [[en:ta:vol1:process:intro_publishing]]) your translation and continue on to Checking Level 3 (see below), if you so desire. 

=== Checking Level 3 === 

Checking Level 3 is done when leaders of at least two church networks agree that the translation is a good one (see [[en:ta:vol1:checking:level3]]). Be sure you work through the Level 3 Checking Questions (see [[en:ta:vol1:checking:level3_questions]]) while you complete this checking level. 

After completing the Level 3 Check, you are encouraged to publish (see [[en:ta:vol1:process:intro_publishing]]) your translation. This is the highest checking level.
