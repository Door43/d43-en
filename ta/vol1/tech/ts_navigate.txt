==== Layout ====

When holding the tablet or phone in a horizontal position, the navigation and menu icons are on the left side of the screen. The navigation and menu icons are on the bottom of the screen if you hold the tablet or phone in a vertical (tall) position.


The top three icons are the working views, the slider moves through the story, the main menu is the three dots.

==== Working Icons ====

The **Chapter or Story** icon is the top left (held horizontally) or bottom left (held vertically) and looks like full sheets of paper. Swipe up to read the entire chapter or story in the source language. Swipe to either side for a blank page to type in the target language translation of the text. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_create]] for more information.)

The **Chunk** icon is the middle icon on the left (held horizontally) or bottom (held vertically) and looks like a solid line square over a dotted line square. Swipe down or up to move from chunk to chunk (a small section of the story or chapter). Swipe to the side for a blank page to type in the target language translation of the text.

The **Check** icon is the bottom icon on the left (held horizontally) or bottom (held vertically) and looks like a clipboard with a check mark. In this view the source text is on the left, the translation work is on the right. Swipe from the right to the left side to show the resources for that chunk. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_resources]] for more information.) Swipe up or down to move from chunk to chunk.

==== Slider ====

The **Slider** icon is a quick way to move through a story or book of the Bible.  Tap-and-hold the dot and swipe towards the bottom (right) or the top (left) of the slider. Numbers may appear on the line that represent the chapter of the book.
