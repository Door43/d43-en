===== How to Translate =====

A basic translation process for any unfoldingWord project is explained here.

Note: the recommendations of the [[http://www.forum-intl.org/resources|Forum of Bible Agencies]] is a helpful reference in the translation of any theological text.

==== Translating the Text ====

As you translate, be sure that you:
  * pray that God would help you make an easily-understandable, Scripturally-accurate translation
  * translate everything that is in the source language
  * do not add anything that that is not necessary for comprehension
  * always do your translation according to the [[:en:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines|Translation Guidelines]]
  * always do your translation according to the [[:en:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith|Statement of Faith]]
  * use the [[:en:obs:notes|translationNotes]] and the [[:en:obe:ktobs|translationWords]] to help you make a better translation

==== What To Start Translating ====

We recommend that you begin by translating Open Bible Stories. You can work your way through the Stories however you want, but we have found [[:en:obs:31|Story #31]] is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand. For more information read [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_what]].

==== Translate from the Source Language ====

**Note:** "Source Language" refers to the language from which the translation is being done. "Target Language" refers to the language into which the translation is being done.''

The **Chapter or Story** icon is the top left and looks like full sheets of paper. Swipe up to read the entire chapter or story. Swipe to the side for a blank page to type in the target language translation of the text.\\

The **Chunk** icon is the middle icon on the left and looks like a solid line square over a dotted line square. Swipe down or up to move from chunk to chunk (a small section of the story or chapter). Swipe  to the side for a blank page to type in the target language translation of the text.\\

The **Check** icon is the bottom icon on the left and looks like a clipboard with a check mark. In this view the source text is on the left, the translation work is on the right. Swipe to the side to show the resources for that chunk. Swipe up or down to move from chunk to chunk.

All of the Translation Notes, Important Terms and Translation Questions have been included in the translationStudio mobile app. See [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_resources]] on how to find the translation resources.
