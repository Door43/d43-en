==== Create Translation Text ====

To write the translation in your language: 
  * Go to the story or book that is being translated.
  * In the **Chapter or Story** view, read the source text.
    * The app is organized to work with blind drafting. You may want to read [[en:ta:vol1:translate:mast]] to understand the steps of blind drafting translation.
  * Do a finger swipe to the side of the screen for a blank page.
  * Tap on the **Begin Translating** icon. The icon will disappear, and the **Chunk** view opens with a blank page. 
  * Tap on the blank paper. A keyboard will open and you can begin working. Type in the translation for that chunk on the page.
    * Start translating with a blind draft - Set aside the source text and draft the chunk as well as you can without looking back at the text. Write everything that you remember about that chunk. Do not look back at the source text for this chunk until you begin the editing steps. Continue doing this with each chunk of the chapter before moving to the checking steps.
  * When you are finished working, swipe up to a different chunk.


==== Edit Translation Text ====

When you use translationStudio, you have the ability to create and change text. Use the **Chunk** or **Check** views to edit existing work that you or another translator created. Your work will be saved automatically every five minutes.

In the **Check** view the source text is on the left, the translation work is on the right. Swipe to the left side to show the resources for that chunk. Swipe up or down to move from chunk to chunk. The UDB and all of the translationNotes, translationWords and translationQuestions have been included in the translationStudio mobile app. See [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_resources]] for more information.

When you are finished working, use the slider at the bottom of the chunk to mark the translation of that chunk done. A message will appear for you to confirm that the chunk is done. Tap 'Confirm' to confirm that the work is done or 'Cancel' to continue translating.

==== Save Translation Text ====

Every five minutes, your work is saved automatically to your device memory. Your work is not saved on unfoldingWord until you upload your work. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_upload]])

==== Delete Translation Text ====

If you accidentally delete a large amount of work, contact [[help@door43.org]].
