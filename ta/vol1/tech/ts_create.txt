===== Create and Edit Text =====

This module answers the question: How do I create and edit text?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_install|Install translationStudio on an Android Device]]

==== Create Translation Text ====

To create a new chapter in your language, navigate to the desired chapter, read the source text, swipe to the side for a blank page and tap on the **Begin Translating** icon. The icon will disappear, tap on the blank paper, keyboard will open and you can begin working. When you are finished working, you can navigate to a different chapter or exit the app.

==== Save Translation Text ====

Every five minutes, your work is saved automatically in your device memory. Your work is not saved on unfoldingWord until you upload your work. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_upload]])

==== Edit Translation Text ====
When you use translationStudio, you have the ability to create and change text. Use the **chunk** or **resources** views to edit existing work that you or another translator created. Your work will be saved automatically every five minutes.

When you are finished working, you can navigate to a different chapter or exit the app.

==== Delete Translation Text ====

If you accidentally delete a large amount of work, contact [[helpdesk@door43.org]].
