==== Translation Guidelines ====
The specific steps involved may vary significantly, depending on the language and context of the translation project. Generally, we consider a good translation to be one that is:\\
  - **Accurate**  - Faithful to the intended meaning of the original, as determined by the Church in that people group and in alignment with the Church global and historical, and consequently:\\
  - **Affirmed by the Church**  - Endorsed and used by the Church.
