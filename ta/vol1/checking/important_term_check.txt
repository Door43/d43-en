==== How to do an Important Term Check ====

  * Make a list of the important terms in the story or Bible passage that you translate, along with the term that you choose for it in the target language. It is best if you can do this on a chart so that you can list the source term in one column and the target term in another column. Further columns could list equivalent terms in other languages and the references where these terms occur in the Bible. Make sure that everyone translating Bible books that use these terms has access to the chart so that you can all use the same terms in your translation.
  * Use the list of words and definitions in the translationWords section of Door43 or translationStudio to help you to make a list of these words and to understand what they mean.
  * Each time the important term occurs in the source text, make sure that the word you have chosen for the translation still makes sense in that context. If it does not, discuss the problem with others on the translation team and try to find a solution together. You may need to use a different term, or you may need to use more than one term for the different contexts, or you may need to find another way to communicate the important term, such as using a longer phrase.
