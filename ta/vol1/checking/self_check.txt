===== Self Check =====

This module answers the question: How do I check my first draft?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:checking:level1|Level One Check]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:first_draft|Make a First Draft]]

  * After you have translated a passage, compare it again to the source text. Make sure that it says all the parts of the message of the source text and does not leave out anything.
  * If translating the Bible, compare your translation with other translations of the same Bible passage. If one of those makes you think of a better way to say something, then revise your translation in that way. If one of those helps you to understand something better than you did before, then change your translation so that it communicates the meaning better.
  * After these steps, read your translation out loud to yourself. Fix anything that does not sound like it is the way that someone from your community would say it. Sometimes parts of sentences need to be put in a different order.






Next we recommend you learn about: [[en:ta:vol1:checking:peer_check|Peer Check]]
