===== Original Manuscripts =====

This module answers the question: Is there more information about the Original Language text?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_retell|Re-telling the Meaning]]

The Bible was written many hundreds of years ago as God inspired his prophets and apostles in ancient times. The Old Testament books were written in Hebrew, with a few parts in Aramaic, the language that the people of Israel used as they lived in exile in Assyria and Babylon. The New Testament books were written in Greek, the language that was used for wider communication throughout the known world between 300 years before Christ and 300 years after Christ. The Old Testament was also translated into Greek about two to three hundred years before Christ.\\

Since there was no paper in those early days, these writings were put on specially prepared animal skins or a material woven of reeds. These writings were extremely important, so trained people copied them over and over by hand, with great care to be accurate and faithful to the original text that they were copying.\\

Over hundreds of years, people made very many copies of the Bible and these copies became spread throughout the ancient world. As the Bible was translated into other ancient languages such as Latin, the translators in various parts of the world used the copies that were available to them when they translated. Later, people began to collect these copies and compare them. While these copies were very much the same, some of them had small differences from each other.\\

To decide which copies were right at these places where there were small differences, Bible scholars decided that the oldest copies were better because they were closer to the originals. Where the more recent copies were different, the Bible scholars decided that these differences were either accidental errors made while copying or sometimes they were ideas put into the copies by people who were not copying in a strictly faithful manner. So, when we try to decide which copies are more reliable or trustworthy, we prefer the older ones and also we prefer the groups of copies that were made by people who followed a tradition that had a reputation for accuracy and faithfulness.\\

==== Missing or Added Verses ====
Some people added words or even whole sentences into the text that they copied. Sometimes this was to explain what was in the text and sometimes it was to add to the ideas in the text, often using phrases from other places in the Bible. Sometimes this happened accidentally, as the person copied something twice or included in the text a comment that someone else had written beside the text. Sometimes words were left out by accident, as well. But over all, the Bible books have been copied with great accuracy and faithfulness over many, many years. By comparing many different copies with each other, Bible scholars can decide which copies are accurate and which ones have errors.\\

Sometimes there will be a footnote with the ULB that says something like, “some ancient authorities add a verse here.” We recommend that the translator include this footnote when translating the passages where it appears in the ULB. For example, there will be a note like this at Mark 16:9-20 and at verses such as Acts 8:37 and 1 John 5:7-8. This means that some copies of the Bible have these verses, but others that are older and considered to be accurate do not. The Bible student needs to be careful to look at the history of the added words and what Bible scholars say about them in order to determine whether they are likely to be from the original text. This requires a great deal of study and many resources that we cannot provide through Door43.org. We recommend that the Bible translator follow these guidelines when translating such passages.\\

  - Translators have a choice about which manuscripts to follow. They can translate as the ULB does, or if they prefer other Bibles that follow other manuscripts, they may follow them.
  - If translators follow the ULB, translating the verses that are there and not translating verses that are not in the ULB, they should also translate the footnotes that the ULB provides in those places.
  - If translators follow other manuscripts (for example, if they translate Acts 8:37 as part of their main text although the ULB does not include that verse), they may need to write their footnote differently, for example, “Some ancient authorities omit verse 37.”
