As you translate, be sure that you:
  * pray that God would help you make an easily-understandable, Scripturally-accurate translation
  * translate everything that is in the source language
  * don't add anything that that is not necessary for comprehension
  * always do your translation according to the [[:en:translation-guidelines]]
  * always do your translation according to the [[:en:statement-of-faith]]
  * use the translation notes and the explanations of important words to help you make a better translation.
