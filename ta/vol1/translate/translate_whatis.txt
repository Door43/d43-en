==== Definition ====

Translation is a process performed between different languages that involves a person (the translator) changing a text from one language (the source language) into a different language (the target language).

There are basically two kinds of translations: literal and dynamic (or meaning-based). 
  * Literal translations focus on representing words in the source language with words in the target language that have similar basic meanings. They also use phrases that have similar structures to the phrases in the source language. This kind of translation allows the reader to see the structure of the source text, but it often makes it difficult or impossible for the reader to understand the meaning of the source text.  
  * Dynamic, meaning-based translations focus on representing the meaning of the source language sentence in its context, and will use whatever words and phrase structures are most appropriate to convey that meaning in the target language. The goal of this kind of translation is to make it easy for the reader to understand the meaning of the source text. This is the kind of translation recommended in this Translation Manual.
