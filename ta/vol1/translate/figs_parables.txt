==== Explanation ====

The kind of communication that we call "parable" includes narrative stories, metaphors, similes, proverbs, and even riddles. The intent of a parable is to convey meaning through a story or word picture. A parable is not an actual account of an event; it is more like an imaginary or hypothetical example (e.g. This could happen). It can be used to explain the kingdom of Heaven by telling a story which the listeners can understand.  Because the lesson comes in the form of a story, the listener or reader can feel themselves being a part of it; it is more likely to make an impact on their lives.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

Parables or teaching stories are best translated as closely as possible to the way they were originally told. Because the parables are set in the culture of Bible times, there may be things that are not easily understood by a modern audience. Follow the guidelines for translating unknown practices or things. But because these are parables and not real events, some things that are known to the target audience can be substituted for things that are unknown to them, as long as they existed in the time period. Parables are best translated as a situation that can be understood within your own culture. The parable is a teaching story, so it is important that all of the details and parts of the story support the main point of the story. It is important that you understand this main point of the parable before you translate it.

When Jesus told a parable, he did not always intend for his hearers to understand what it meant right away (for example, the parable of the farmer planting seeds). So do __not__ try to explain the story or what Jesus was teaching, but simply translate the parable. Use the form that your language has for communicating that a narrative is an imaginative story (or even a story whose purpose is to teach something) and not an account of a historical event.

Parables seldom (if ever) contain the names of specific individuals (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable and what is a narrative account.)
