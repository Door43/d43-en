===== Hypothetical Situations =====

**This page answers the question:** //What are hypothetical situations?//

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:

==== Definition ====

Something that is hypothetical is 'assumed' or 'supposed.' A hypothetical situation is a possible scenario from any point in time: past, present or future. A hypothetical situation in the past did not happen, but could have happened under different circumstances. A hypothetical situation in the present or future may or may not actually happen - the speaker presents it as hypothetical because he does not know or it depends on the actions of others. It could possibly happen or it may never happen. A hypothetical situation might mean asking a “what if” question. It might be a “suppose” or “if only” statement. Hypothetical situations are good teaching tools. Jesus often used them in his teaching.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * How would your language express a situation that could never happen?
  * How would you communicate a “suppose” scenario that could happen right now?
  *How would your language express a situation that may or may not happen in the future?
  * Does your language have a special way of indicating a hypothetical situation in the past?
  * How does your language express an “if only” or “I wish” scenario which also implies some emotion?

It is important in translation to be able to recognize a hypothetical situation in the text and use appropriate words or phrases. You may need to show the timing of the hypothetical situation (e.g. past, present or future). You may need to clarify that the scenario is only a possibility: that it might be true or not likely to be true; that it could possibly happen or would never happen.  Hypothetical situations may or may not imply emotions or reasons. Some hypothetical statements may use expressions such as “what if”, “suppose” or “if only” to help the reader understand the type of hypothetical situation.  Perhaps your language uses special wording or specific language structures to communicate each of these things.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

1. Consider a hypothetical situation that **would never happen**:

In Luke chapter 18 verse 25 Jesus was teaching his disciples about how being rich can make it hard to enter God’s kingdom. To emphasize this, he said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to submit to God’s rule in their life.

The hypothetical part of this is that a large camel could never squeeze through the eye of a very small sewing needle! Jesus used this hypothetical scenario to emphasize his teaching point.

2. Consider a “suppose” scenario that **could possibly happen**.

In Matthew chapter 12 verse 11, Jesus was pointing out to the religious leaders that they were not being honest when they judged people for working on the Sabbath day. He told them, “Suppose one of you has a sheep and it falls into a deep hole on the Sabbath day. Certainly, you would work to pull it out of the hole!”

Jesus wasn’t talking about a specific person who did this. Rather, he was talking about a possible situation which could and often did happen. He used the hypothetical story to help listeners understand his own work (God's work).

3. The following is an example of a hypothetical scenario **in the past**:

In Matthew 11:21, Jesus said that //if the people living in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon had been able to see the miracles that he – Jesus – performed, they would have repented long ago.//

This is a hypothetical situation that we know did not happen. Jesus was making the spiritual teaching point of “what if” these people had seen the miracles? If they had seen the miracles, then, they would have repented.

4. Often a hypothetical situation in the past **expresses an emotion, such as regret**. For example, consider Exodus 16:3:

>“//If only we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt...//.”

Here the Israelites are afraid that they will have to suffer and die of hunger in the wilderness, and so they are wishing that they had stayed in Egypt and died there with full stomachs.
