===== Irony =====

**This page answers the question:** //What is irony?//

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:

==== Definition ====

Irony is using words that appear to say the opposite of what you mean. Irony is typically used to be humorous or to place emphasis on how different something is from what it should be, or how far someone's belief is from the truth. Irony makes these points more powerfully than direct statements do. In irony, sometimes a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it. 

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * If the irony would be understood correctly, translate it as is.
  * If the irony would not be understood correctly, you could indicate that the thoughts are not truly those of the speaker but of someone else. For example,  In Mark 7:9, Jesus says to the Pharisees, "Rightly you set aside the commandment of God in order to set up your own tradition." Jesus is putting into words what the Pharisees actually do, even though they would never admit that they do this. Everyone who hears this, including Jesus, knows that it is wrong to set aside a commandment of God. So Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees in a powerful way by using words that seem to commend them for doing wrong. If the irony would not be understood, this could be translated as "You think you have done well in following your traditions. But as you do that, you have rejected God's commandments."

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?” -Luke 22:64b (WEB)

The soldiers were hitting Jesus and they told him to prophecy and say who hit him. This was irony. They were implying that if he were a prophet, he should be able to tell who hit him, but they did not believe that he was a real prophet. They told him to prophecy because they were mocking him and wanted to prove that he was not really a prophet.

If the irony would not be understood here, the soldier's words could be translated more directly as, "You are not a prophet - you cannot even tell us who struck you."

>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” -Mark 2:17a (WEB)

When Jesus spoke here of righteous people, that was irony. Jesus knew that there are no righteous people. But some people thought that they really were righteous, and they didn't think that Jesus should allow sinners to follow him. But Jesus invited sinners to go to him and turn from their sins. He was not inviting people who think they are righteous and think that they do not need to turn from their sins. Only people who know that they are sinners would repent of their sins.

If the irony would not be understood here, part of Mark 2:17 could be translated as "I have not come to call those who think they are righteous to repentance, but those who know they are sinners."

==== Examples from English ====

>"The used-car salesman told me that this car was a great bargain at only $1000, so I bought it. But now I find out that the radiator doesn't work, and it will cost me $4000 to get it repaired. __Great bargain. Yeah, right__."

In this example, the speaker uses irony to express that the reality of the car was totally different than what the car salesman said, so he repeats the car salesman's words, but now mocking them as false.

>"Thanks for holding the door open for me."

This would be an ironic statement made to someone who did not hold the door open for the speaker. It expresses that the other person should have been kind enough to hold it open, and that the speaker is annoyed with that person for not doing that. The expression of thanks for something that both the hearer and the speaker know that the hearer did not do has become, through irony, a rebuke for not doing it.
