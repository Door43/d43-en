===== Create Clear Translations =====

This module answers the question: How do I create clear translations?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:

To create a clear translation from the source text into your language:
  * Check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.
  * Understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it.
  * You may need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause if it is in some other form, such as an abstract noun.
  * You may need to change passive verbs to the active form.
  * Look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by "of."
  
=== Check Pronouns ===
You will need to **check the pronouns**  in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers. Pronouns are words that stand in the place of a noun or a noun phrase. They refer back to something that has already been mentioned.\\
Always check carefully that it is clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.

=== Identify Participants ===
Next you need to **understand who is doing the action.**  A clear translation will **identify the PARTICIPANTS**. The PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things that take part in that event. The subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it are the main PARTICIPANTS. When re-expressing an EVENT idea as a verb, it is often necessary to state who or what are the PARTICIPANTS in that event. Usually this will be clear from the context.\\ 
\\ 
=== Change Event Ideas ===
A clear translation may need to **express EVENT ideas as verbs**. You may need to **change each EVENT idea into an active clause** to be sure it is understood. 
\\ 
When preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any EVENT ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. See if you can re-express the meaning using a verb to express the EVENT idea. If, however, your language also uses nouns to express EVENT ideas and the event or action sounds more natural as a noun, then use the noun form.\\ 

=== Passive Verbs ===
A clear translation may need to change **any PASSIVE verbs to the ACTIVE form**.
In the ACTIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person who does the action. In the PASSIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person or thing to which the action is done. For example, "John hit Bill" is an active sentence. "Bill was hit by John" is a passive sentence.
Many languages do not have a PASSIVE form, only the ACTIVE form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the PASSIVE form into the ACTIVE form.\\ 
\\ 
=== Look at Each 'Of' Phrase ===
To make a clear translation, you will also need to **look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by "of."** In many languages, “of” constructions are not as frequent as they are in Greek, the original language of the New Testament books. Study the meaning of each one and re-express the meaning of the phrase in a way which makes the relationship between the parts clear.\\ 
\\ 
Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.
