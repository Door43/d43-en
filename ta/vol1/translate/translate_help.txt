==== Using Translation Helps ====

To help translators make the best translation possible, **Translation Notes**, **Translation Words** and **Translation Questions** have been created. \\

There is a set of [[:en:obs:notes]] (https://door43.org/en/obs/notes) and [[:en:obs:notes:questions:home]] (https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/questions/home) for the Open Bible Stories, and also [[en:bible:notes:home]] (https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/home) and [[en:bible:questions:comprehension:home]] (https://door43.org/en/bible/questions/comprehension/home) for the Bible. All of the Important Terms for the OBS and the Bible are listed on the [[en:obe:home]] ([[https://door43.org/en/obe/home]]) page.

**Translation Notes** are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain some of the Bible background that the translator needs to know to translate Open Bible Stories, as well as inform translators about different ways that they might express the same meaning.

The **Translation Words** are key terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible that are important to translate correctly. Each of these important terms has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places where that term is used in either Open Bible Stories or the Bible. This is to show the translator other ways that the important term is used and to ensure that it has been translated correctly in those places, too.

The **Comprehension translationQuestions** can be used to self-check your translation. Can the Target Language translation be used to correctly answer each of the questions? The translationQuestions are also a good tool to use for each level of checking.

Once you have consulted the Translation Notes, Translation Words and Comprehension Questions, then you are ready to make the best translation. 

**Please use the Translation Notes & Translation Words when doing your translation!**
