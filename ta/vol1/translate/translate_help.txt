This module answers the question: Where do I find help for translating?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_what|What to Start Translating]]

To help translators make the best translation possible, Translation Notes and Translation Words have been created. There is a set of [[:en:obs:notes|Translation Notes]] (https://door43.org/en/obs/notes) and [[:en:obe:kt:home|Translation Words]] (https://door43.org/en/obe/kt/home) for Open Bible Stories, and also [[en:bible:notes:home|Translation Notes]] (https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/home) and [[en:obe:home|Translation Words]] (https://door43.org/en/obe/home) for the Bible.\\ 
\\ 
Translation Notes are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain some of the Bible background that the translator needs to know to translate Open Bible Stories, as well as inform translators about different ways that they might express the same meaning.\\ 
\\ 
The Translation Words are key terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible that are important to translate correctly. Each of these important terms has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places where that term is used in either Open Bible Stories or the Bible. This is to show the translator other ways that the important term is used and to ensure that it has been translated correctly in those places, too.\\ 
\\ 
Once you have consulted the Translation Notes and Translation Words, then you are ready to make the best translation.\\

**Please use the Translation Notes & Translation Words when doing your translation!**
