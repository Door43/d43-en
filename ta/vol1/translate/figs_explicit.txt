===== Explicit and Implicit =====

This module answers the question: What do the words explicit and implicit mean?\\
==== Definition ====

There are two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages. One is called **//explicit//** and the other is called //**implicit**//. When a speaker, or writer, has a message to give, he has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.

  * Information that the speaker states clearly is called **//explicit//** information. This is the information that the speaker or writer has decided to include in what he says.
  * Information that the speaker does not state clearly is called //**implicit**//information. This is the information that the speaker or writer expects his audience to already know, and so he knows that he does not need to include that information in what he writes.

When a writer writes, he has in mind a certain audience who will read what he writes. The writer has a good idea of what this audience does and does not know about what he is writing about, and so the writer chooses to include the important information that he knows his audience does not know. He chooses to not include the information that his audience already knows. 

==== Translation Suggestions ====

Although implicit information is not stated in words but is only implied, it is information that the hearer or reader needs to know if he is to understand the meaning of the message. The speaker or writer has succeeded in communicating his message only if the hearer or reader correctly understands what was clearly stated as well as what was implied.

When we translate the Bible, we are making it available to a new audience. This new audience will know some things about what is in the Bible, but often they will not know some of the implicit information that the original writer left out because his original audience already knew it. The new target audience, then, will need to know some of that implicit information in order to understand some parts of the text. So in order for the Bible to communicate its message successfully, the translator needs to include some of the information that the original writer left as implicit for the original audience. If this information can be included in just a few words, then the translator may decide to include this information in the text of the translation. But if it will take more than a few words, it is best to include this information in a footnote. The translator will need to think about his target audience and decide when to include some of this implicit information. Checking the translation with the community is a good way for the translator to find out where he needs to include some implicit information so that they can understand the translation.
