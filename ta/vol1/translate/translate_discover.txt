===== Discover the Meaning of the Text =====

This module answers the question: How Do I Discover the Meaning of the Text?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_process|The Translation Process]]

There are many different things that we can do to help us to discover the meaning of the text, that is, to make sure that we understand what the text is trying to say. Here are a few suggestions:
  - Read the whole passage through before you translate it. Understand the main point of the whole passage before you begin to translate it. If it is a narrative passage, such as a story of one of Jesus' miracles, picture the original situation. Imagine you were there. Imagine how people felt.
  - When translating the Bible, always use at least two versions of the Bible together as your source text. Comparing two versions will help you to think about the meaning, so that you do not just follow the words of one version literally. The two versions should be:
      * One version that follows the form of the original language fairly closely, such as the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB).
      * One meaning-based version, such as the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB).
  - Use the Important Terms resources to learn about terms that you are not familiar with. Words sometimes have more than one meaning. Make sure that you have understood the right meaning of the word in the passage.
  - Also use the translationNotes that are with the ULB Bible. These are available in the translationStudio program and the Door43 website. These will explain things about the passage that may not be clear. If possible, also use other reference books, such as other versions of the Bible, a Bible dictionary, or Bible commentaries.
