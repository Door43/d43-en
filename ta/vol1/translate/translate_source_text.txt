==== Factors to Consider For A Source Text ====

When choosing a source text, there are a number of factors that must be considered:

  * **[[en:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith]]** - Is the text in line with the Statement of Faith?
  * **[[en:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines]]** - Is the text in line with the Translation Guidelines?
  * **Language** - Is the text in a suitable language that translators and checkers understand well?
  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_licensing|Licensing]]** - Is the text released under a license that gives sufficient legal freedom?
  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_version|Versioning]]** - Is the text the latest, most updated version?
  * **[[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_original]]** - Does the translation team understand the difference between source languages and original languages?
  * **[[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_manuscripts]]** - Does the translation team understand about Original Manuscripts and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_textvariants]]?

It is important the the leaders of the churches in the language group agree that the source text is a good one. The Open Bible Stories are available in many source languages on https://unfoldingword.org/stories/. There are also translations of the Bible there to be used as sources for translation in English, and soon other languages, as well.
