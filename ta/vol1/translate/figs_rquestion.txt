A rhetorical question is a question to which the speaker does not expect an answer because he is not looking for information. Speakers use rhetorical questions to express deep emotion or to encourage hearers to think deeply about something. The Bible contains many rhetorical questions, often to express sarcasm or to rebuke or scold the hearer. Speakers of some languages use rhetorical questions for other reasons as well.

==== Description ====

A rhetorical question is a question to which the speaker does not expect an answer because he is not looking for information.
>__Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her veils?__ Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number! (Jeremiah 2:32 ULB)
This question is rhetorical because both Yahweh and Jeremiah's hearers know that women never forget temporary things like jewelry and veils. Yahweh is rebuking the people of Judah for forgetting Yahweh, who is so much greater than those things.

=== Reason this is a translation issue ===

  * Some readers may think that a question is a request for information. 
  * Some readers might think that the purpose is of a question is something other than what it really is.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Those who stood by said, "__Is this how you insult God’s high priest?__" (Acts 23:4 ULB)\\
Those who stood by were scolding Paul because they did not think he should have spoken as he did to the high priest.
>Jezebel his wife replied to him, "__Do you not still rule the kingdom of Israel?__" (1 Kings 21:7 ULB)\\
Jezebel was rebuking King Ahab for being unwilling to take over a poor man's property. She was implying that since he was the king of Israel he should feel free to take the man's property.
>Zedekiah ... slapped Micaiah on the cheek, and said, "__Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh take to go from me to speak to you?__" (1 Kings 22:24 ULB)\\
Zedekiah was sarcastically repeating Micaiah's words that Yahweh had spoken to Micaiah.
>__Why did I not die when I came out from the womb?__ (Job 3:11 ULB)\\
Job was saying that he was so sad that he wished he had never been born.

==== Translation Strategies ====

Be sure you know that you are dealing with a rhetorical question and not an information question. Then be sure you know what the purpose of the rhetorical question is. Is it to encourage or rebuke or shame the hearer? Is it to bring up a new topic? Is it to do something else?

If using the rhetorical question would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing so. If not, here are other options:
  - Add the answer after the question.
  - Change the rhetorical question to a statement.
  - Change the rhetorical question to a statement, and then follow it with a short question.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. Add the answer after the question.
  * **__Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her veils?__ Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number!** (Jeremiah 2:32 ULB)
    * "__Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her veils? Of course not!__ Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number!"

  * **Zedekiah ... slapped Micaiah on the cheek, and said, "__Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh take to go from me to speak to you?__"** (1 Kings 22:24 ULB)
    * "Zedekiah ... slapped Micaiah on the cheek, and said, '__Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh take to go from me to speak to you? You fool, he did no such thing!__'"

2. Change the rhetorical question to a statement.
  * **Those who stood by said, "__Is this how you insult God’s high priest?__"** (Acts 23:4 ULB)
    * "Those who stood by said, '__You should not insult God’s high priest!__'"

  * **__Why did I not die when I came out from the womb?__** (Job 3:11 ULB)
    * "__I wish I had died when I came out from the womb!__"

3. Change the rhetorical question to a statement, and then follow it with a short question.
  * **Jezebel his wife replied to him, "__Do you not still rule the kingdom of Israel?__"** (1 Kings 21:7 ULB)
    * "Jezebel his wife replied to him, "__You still rule the kingdom of Israel, don't you?__""
