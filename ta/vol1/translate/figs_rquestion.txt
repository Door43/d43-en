==== Definition ====

A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. An answer is not expected for rhetorical questions. A rhetorical question may be used to express deep emotion or to encourage the reader to think deeply on a topic. At times, rhetorical questions are used for sarcasm, rebuking or scolding. Some languages have other purposes as well.

Watch the video on the "Kinds of Questions" for the [[http://youtu.be/ePSJS2RVoV4|computer]] (http://youtu.be/ePSJS2RVoV4) or the [[http://youtu.be/7c-7LOqLBp4|tablet/phone]] (http://youtu.be/7c-7LOqLBp4) to learn the difference between real and rhetorical questions.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * Determine the purpose of the rhetorical question.
  * If your language would use a rhetorical question for that purpose, then use it.
  * Languages may have different forms of rhetorical questions for different purposes. For example, if a parent wants to scold or rebuke his child for writing on the walls, some languages could do it with different forms of rhetorical questions, such as: "Why are you writing on the wall?" or "Who told you to write on the wall?" or "Is that __your__  wall that you are writing on?" Other languages would use a statement, such as: "I told you not to write on the walls," or a command, such as: "Do not write on the walls!" 
  * If, after determining the purpose of the rhetorical question, your decide that your language would use a statement or a command for that purpose, then use a statement or command instead of a rhetorical question. For example, in Mark 13:2, Jesus says to one of his disciples, "Do you see these great buildings?" (ULB). Jesus knows that the disciple sees them, but he uses a rhetorical question to draw attention to them. If your language would not use a rhetorical question to draw people's attention to something, then use whatever form is natural, such as a command, "Look at these great buildings," or a statement, "These buildings are very great."

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>//Zechariah said to the angel, "How will I know this will happen? For I am an old man, and my wife also is very old.”// -Luke 1:18 (ULB)

When Zechariah asked this rhetorical question, he was indicating that he could not believe that what the angel said was true.

>//Everyone who heard about this kept thinking about what had happened and said, “So then, what will this child become?” For they realized that the hand of the Lord was with him.// -Luke 1:66 (ULB)

The people were not expecting anyone to answer their question. They were simply expressing that they wondered about it because they were impressed by the surprising things they had heard about his birth.

==== Examples from English ====

>//"Could you do this for me?"//

Someone could say this if they want to politely tell someone to do something.

>//"What possessed you to think of doing that?"//

A mother might scold her child by saying this.
