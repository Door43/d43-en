====== Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural ======

Some languages, like English, have only one word for ‘you’ regardless of how many people are being spoken to. English speakers can refer to one person as ‘you’ or to many people as ‘you’. Often the context will make it clear as to whether the word ‘you’ refers to one person or more than one.  Looking at the other pronouns in the sentence will help you distinguish the audience.

Some languages have more than one word for ‘you’ depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou-singular|'singular']] form of ‘you’. If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the ‘plural’ form of ‘you.’ Some languages have a ‘dual’ form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.

The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. These languages both have a singular form of you and a plural form of you. When reading the Bible in a language that does not have distinct singular and plural forms of ‘you’, the context will often make it clear whether the word “you” is intended to refer to one person, to two people, or to more than two people.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Note that for many languages, the decision about what form of the pronoun to use will also affect the form of the verb associated with it, even in cases where the word “you” is not expressed (for example when a command is given).

===== Examples from the Bible =====

  * Mark 10:35-36 //And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And [Jesus] said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”//

Jesus is asking the **two**, James and John, what they want him to do for them.

  * Mark 11:1-2 //…Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.//

The context makes it clear that Jesus is addressing two persons, so the dual form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. Here the verbs “go” and “untie” would need the dual form of “you”.

In instructional text, the “you” is often **Plural**  since it is addressing a wide audience. Here is an example:

  * 1 Peter 1:17 //Since you call on a Father who judges each man’s work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.//
