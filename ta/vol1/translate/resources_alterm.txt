==== Description =====

Alternate meanings refer to 
  * When there are multiple ways to express something
  * When there are different understandings of what the word or phrase means. 

The note will have the ULB text followed by the explanation starting with the words "Possible meanings are." The translation suggestions are numbered with the preferred meaning first. If the meaning is given in a way that can be used as a translation, it is in quotes. 

It is the decision of the translator to choose the best alternate meaning translation suggestion that will convey the most accurate translation in the target language.

==== Translation Notes Examples ====
> You are like a young lion among the nations, like a monster in the seas (Ezekiel 32:2 ULB)

  * **like a monster in the seas** - Possible meanings are that 1) he was powerful or 2) he was not doing anything important.
This note has the ULB text followed by the explanation that starts with 'Possible meanings are.' The translation suggestions are numbers with the first suggestion being the most likely meaning of the ULB text.

> But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees (Luke 5:8 ULB)

  * **fell down at Jesus' knees** - Possible meanings are 1) "bowed down at Jesus' feet" or 2) "lay down on the ground at Jesus' feet" or 3) "knelt down before Jesus." Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of  humility and respect for Jesus. 
These translation suggestions explain the meaning of Simon Peter's action of falling down at Jesus' knees. The alternate meanings are listed in order of the preferred meaning of the text.
