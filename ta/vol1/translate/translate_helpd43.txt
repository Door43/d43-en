===== Use the Translation Notes on Door43 =====

=== Open Bible Stories ===
For translating Open Bible Stories, it is best to open the webpage of the story in the target language and also the webpage of the story with [[:en:obs:notes|Translation Notes]] (https://door43.org/en/obs/notes). Unless someone has already translated the Translation Notes into the target language, they will be in the source language. To begin with, both webpages will be in the source language.\\ 
\\ 
This [[http://youtu.be/5fFl8crhglE|video]] (http://youtu.be/5fFl8crhglE) (1 minute 20 seconds) will give a quick overview of how to use the Translation Notes.
  * The stories are separated into separate pages with a part of the story and a picture for that part of the story on each page (called a frame).
  * The webpage that you opened in the target language has the picture and the text from the story, but it is still in the source language.
  * You can start translating the story into the target language underneath the source language on that page.
  * There is a list of the Important Terms from each part of the story below where you are translating. This list is there to help you to translate them correctly. Click on the green word to go to another page that will give more information on how to translate each Important Term.
  * Below that are the Translation Notes. These Notes explain how to translate some parts of the story that might be difficult. The Note should help you understand how to translate.

=== The Bible ===
The process of translating the Bible is very similar to the process of translating Open Bible Stories, so please read the instructions above. Translating Open Bible Stories will give you good practice in how to translate, and how to use these translation tools. We highly recommend that you translate Open Bible stories first, and then start translating the Bible. 

When you are ready to start translating the Bible, open the page that has the first chunk of the Bible book that you want to translate and also the Translation Notes for that chunk, in both the target language and the source language, as explained above. The page that has a link to the text and notes for each book of the Bible in English is here: https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/home. Each page will have a chunk of Bible text, usually 2 to 3 verses, then the list of Translation Words (Important Terms), then the Translation Notes for that chunk of Bible text. Each page is very much like a frame from Open Bible Stories, and works the same way.
