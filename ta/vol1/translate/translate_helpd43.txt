===== Use the Translation Notes on Door43 =====
For translating Open Bible Stories, it is best to open the webpage of the story in the target language and also the webpage of the story with [[:en:obs:notes|Translation Notes]] (https://door43.org/en/obs/notes). Unless someone has already translated the Translation Notes into the target language, they will be in the source language. To begin with, both webpages will be in the source language.\\

This [[http://youtu.be/5fFl8crhglE|video]] (http://youtu.be/5fFl8crhglE) (1 minute 20 seconds) will give a quick overview of how to use the Translation Notes.
  * The stories are separated into separate pages with a part of the story and a picture for that part of the story on each page (called a frame).
  * The webpage that you opened in the target language has the picture and the text from the story, but it is still in the source language.
  * You can start translating the story into the target language underneath the source language on that page.
  * There is a list of the Important Terms from each part of the story below where you are translating. This list is there to help you to translate them correctly. Click on the green word to go to another page that will give more information on how to translate each Important Term.
  * Below that are the Translation Notes. These Notes explain how to translate some parts of the story that might be difficult. The Note should help you understand how to translate.
