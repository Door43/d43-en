First person is how a speaker normally refers to himself. English has the first person pronouns ”I” and ”we”. (Also: me, my, mine, us, our, ours)
Second person is how a  speaker normally refers to the person or people he is speaking to. English uses the second person pronoun ”you.” (Also: your, yours)
Third person is how a speaker normally refers to someone else. English has the third person pronouns "he", "she", "it" and "they". (Also: him, his, her, hers, its, them, their, theirs.) 
Sometimes people use the third person to refer to themselves or to the people they are speaking to. See the examples of this from the Bible below. In some languages, first, second, and third person are shown with a prefix or suffix on a word.  In some of these languages, using a pronoun in addition to the prefix or suffix indicates a special emphasis on the thing it refers to.  
===== Translation Suggestions =====
Do what is natural and accurate in your own language. If your language does not always use a pronoun, do not use one simply because English does.\\ 
\\ 
It is important to note that sometimes in the Bible, the text changes from writing in the first person to the third person. You might not be able to do that in your language. Translate with one or the other but maintain accuracy and clarity.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
Sometimes people use the third person to refer to themselves or to the people they are speaking to.\\ 
\\ 
**Psalms 89:5-8** “The heavens praise your wonders, Lord, your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones. For who in the skies above can compare with the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings? In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared; **he** is more awesome than all who surround him. Who is like **you**, Lord God Almighty? **You**, Lord, are mighty, and your faithfulness surrounds **you**.”\\ 
\\ 
//Do you see how it changes back and forth from addressing God directly (**you**) to talking about him in the third person (**he**)? Many of the Psalms do this.//\\ 
\\ 
**Job 40:6-9** ‘Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm: “Brace yourself like a man; **I** will question you, and you shall answer me. Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself? Do you have an arm like God’s, and can your voice thunder like **his**?”\\ 
\\ 
//Here God speaks, first calling himself “I” then referring to himself in the third person.//\\ 
\\ 
**Luke 13:15** ‘Then the Lord answered him, “**You** hypocrites! Does not each of **you** on the Sabbath untie **his** ox or **his** donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?’\\ 
\\ 
//Often when Jesus is teaching, he uses the second person. Sometimes, the instruction will switch to a third-person pronoun as it does in the above example. In those cases some languages might need to say "you" to keep the meaning clear.//
===== Examples from English =====
First person ~ “I gave the dog a bone.”\\
