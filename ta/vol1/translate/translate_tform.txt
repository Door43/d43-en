===== Translate for Meaning =====

This module answers the question: Why should I translate for meaning?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_dynamic|Meaning-Based Translations]]

The meaning of some passages of Scripture are not clear, even in the original. The Apostle Peter said that Paul's letters "contain some things that are hard to understand" (2 Peter 3:16). \\
We also know that unbelievers cannot understand some of God's deeper truth because they do not have the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 2:14). Therefore, we are not suggesting that a good translation will enable an unbeliever to understand all of the mysteries of faith! Even the most godly person does not understand everything in the Bible. \\\\ 
\\ 
A good translation will clearly communicate all of the things that are clear in the original text. However, if the meaning was unclear in the original, it should remain unclear in the translation! The translator must strive to keep all of the clarity of the original text.
