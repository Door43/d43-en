==== Description =====

Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULB means. Sometimes the same word or phrase is also used in the UDB, so the notes have an explanation of the word or phrase. 

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

Simple explanations about words or phrases are in sentence format. For example:
> The fishermen had gotten out of them and were __washing their nets__. (Luke 5:2 ULB)

  * **washing their nets**  - They were cleaning their fishing nets in order to use them again to catch fish.

> they __motioned__ to their partners in the other boat  (Luke 5:7 ULB)

  * **motioned**  - They were too far from shore to call so they made gestures, probably waving their arms.

Translators use these explanations to determine the most accurate form and words to use in their language that convey the exact same meaning.
