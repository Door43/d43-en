  * Open Bible Stories has its own set of translationNotes and translationQuestions.
  * The ULB puts the form of the original languages of the Bible into modern English to show the structure and style of the original.
  * The UDB is a translation that seeks to present the meaning of the Bible in a way that is simple and easy to understand.
  * The translationWords are important terms that are taken from the OBS and ULB.
  * The translationNotes for the Bible are explanations of the text of the ULB.
  * translationWords are important words to know and should be translated accurately.
  * translationNotes provide additional information on ways to translate into your language clearly and naturally.
