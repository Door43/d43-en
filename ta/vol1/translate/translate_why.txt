==== Why Translate the Bible? ====

The purpose of this course is to train you to become a Bible translator. Of all the types of work you could do, perhaps the greatest investment you could ever make is translating God’s Word into your language for the sake of helping your people grow as disciples of Jesus. It is essential for you to be committed to this task, to take your responsibility very seriously, and to pray that the Lord will help you in this highly important endeavor.

God has spoken to us in the Bible. He originally inspired the writers of the Bible to write his Word using the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek languages. He used about 40 different authors over a period from about 1400 B.C. to A.D. 100 to record his word in the languages which were spoken at that time in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. By recording his Word in those languages, God ensured that the people at those times and in those places could understand what was written.

Today, however, your people in your country do not understand Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, so it is necessary to translate God’s Word into the language which they speak. In this way, they will be able to fully understand the message from God to them.

We often speak of someone’s mother tongue or heart language, which usually means the language they first spoke as a child and the one which they use at home. It is the language in which they are most comfortable and which they use to express their deepest thoughts. We want you and your people to be able to read God's Word in your and their heart language.

It is important to know that every language is important and valuable. Your dialect is just as important as the national language spoken in your country. You should not be ashamed to speak your dialect. It is no less important than other more well-known languages and it can express meaning just as well as they can. Sometimes, those in minority groups like you feel ashamed of their language and try not to use it around the people who are in the majority in their nation. But there is nothing inherently more important, more prestigious, or more educated about the national language than there is about your local language. There are nuances and shades of meaning in your language which are very important. Each one of us should speak whichever language we are most comfortable with and with which we can express the feelings, thoughts and desires of our hearts. Each one of us needs to have God’s Word in our heart language.
