===== Translation Checking Manual =====

=== This manual describes how to check translated biblical content for accuracy, clarity, and naturalness. ===

**//Part A, for the translation team// **
==== Introduction ====

As part of the translation process, it is necessary that several people check the translation in various ways to make sure that it is clearly communicating the message that it should communicate. This is a guide to the process of checking, in the form of a scale with three levels.

This checking scale helps to show the extent to which the accuracy and clarity of a translation have been verified. These checking levels have been developed by the    __[[https://unfoldingword.org|unfoldingWord network]]__ , the same group that manages Door43 with the help of many volunteers, and they are used to indicate the checking level of all biblical content on Door43.

==== Definition of a Checking Level ====

There are three checking levels: [[en:ta:workbench:check:level1|Checking Level One]], [[en:ta:workbench:check:level2|Checking Level Two]], and [[en:ta:workbench:check:level3|Checking Level Three]]. Any translation that has not yet been checked to Level One is considered to have not been checked and is assigned no checking status.

The purpose of having several Checking Levels is to make translated materials quickly available to the church, while also allowing the content to continue to be checked and corroborated in an open environment. At all times, the degree to which its accuracy has been checked will be clearly indicated. We believe this will result in a faster checking process, allow broad church participation and ownership, and produce better translations.

==== How Checking Levels Work ====

Here are some important tips to remember when working with Checking Levels:

  * Only translations that have reached Checking Level One (Checking Level Two for Bible translations) or higher will be made available on the [[https://unfoldingword.org/stories|unfoldingWord website]] and the unfoldingWord mobile app.
  * Only translations that have reached Checking Level Three will be approved as source texts for other translations.
  * When a Checking Level has been completed and all appropriate edits have been made to door43, the checkers will inform unfoldingWord of the details of the check. unfoldingWord will harvest a copy of what is on door43, digitally publish a static copy of it on the [[https://unfoldingword.org/stories|unfoldingWord website]] and make it available on the unfoldingWord mobile app. A print-ready PDF will also be produced and made available for download. The checked version on door43 will remain fluid, allowing for future checking and editing.
  * For Open Bible Stories projects: Only Open Bible Stories translations that have been made from version 3.0 or higher of the English source text are eligible to be checked to Level One (or higher). Translations made from versions before 3.0 [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_version|must be updated]] before proceeding with Checking Levels.

==== The Checking Levels ====

The strategy for quality assurance of unfoldingWord content, including Open Bible Stories, is described briefly here and in detail in the document [[http://distantshores.org/resources/whitepapers/quality-assurance|“Quality Assurance of Open-License Biblical Content”]].

The three-level checking scale we use is dependent on the unfoldingWord [[:en:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]] and [[:en:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]]. All translated content is compared against the theology of the Statement of Faith and against the procedures and methodologies of the Translation Guidelines. With these documents forming the foundation, these are the three levels of checking used in the unfoldingWord project:

[[en:ta:workbench:check:level1|Checking Level One - Internal Check]]

[[en:ta:workbench:check:level2|Checking Level Two - External Check]]

[[en:ta:workbench:check:level3|Checking Level Three - Authenticated Check]]

==== Checking the Checkers ====

The process and checking framework described in this document depends on an ongoing process of checking and revising content, as determined by the Church that uses the content. Feedback loops are encouraged (and modeled in translation software, where feasible) with a view to maximizing input from the greatest number of users of the content. The translations of the content are made available on the [[http://door43.org|Door43]] translation platform, which is designed to make it easy for users to collaboratively create content that increases in quality over time.
