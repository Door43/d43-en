====== Frequently Used Pages - Job ======

We have found that it is very useful to bookmark pages that we use frequently. Bookmarked, or added to favorites, pages allows the Internet user to quickly find frequently used pages.

==== Bookmarked Pages ====

Here is a list of the pages that we will be using a lot while writing notes for Job. You might want to bookmark these:

  * [[:en:bible:notes:job:home|List of all Job chunks]]
  * [[:en:obe:home|Important Terms List]]
  * [[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:quick-reference-notes|Reference Guide for Notes]]
  * [[:en:ta:ta-topics|Translation Academy Topics list]]
  * [[:en:ulb:ep:18-job.usfm|The entire book of Job in the ULB]]
  * [[:en:udb:ep:18-job.usfm|The entire book of Job in the UDB]]

Experienced note writers have a list of resources that they find very helpful:

==== Organizing the Pages ====

All of us work differently, so that one particular way does not suit us all. Some will use the bookmark bar or a favorites folder or have all the pages set as 'home pages.'

For example, some have found it very useful to have the above pages that we use during the workshop to be ‘saved tabs.’ Here are the links to the how to have saved tabs for 3 browsers:
