====== Icons ======


Here is a great place to put in ideas for icons.


Add an icon - state the purpose - discuss. :)


How about a icon for the following:

Well Done: An Icon of a thumbs up   {{en:ta:resources:thumbsup.png?nolink&100x100}}


Test Yourself: An Icon of a check mark   {{en:ta:resources:check.png?nolink&100x100}}


Pause and Think: An Icon of an hourglass   {{en:ta:resources:pause_think.png?nolink&100x100}}


I created rough and ready icons so what do people think?
