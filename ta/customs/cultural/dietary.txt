====== Dietary Customs ======


===== Definition: =====


In the culture of the Old Testament, there were only two meals a day morning and evening. The people had a midday rest and after this they did a number of important activities. It was during the midday rest that:


    * Abraham sat in the door of his tent for a rest. Genesis 18:1
    * Ish-Bosheth stayed in his house 2 Samuel 4:5.


The women prepared the evening meal on a fire for the men when they returned from work.


The meal normally consisted of vegetables or a lentil stew (Genesis 5:29 & 34; Daniel 1:12) and was dished out of the common pot with a piece of bread. The Israelites were given a list of animals that could be eaten. (Leviticus 11)


~~In Deuteronomy 8:10 the command was given that after you have eaten and were satisfied to bless the LORD your God for the good land provided the substance.
