====== Marriage Customs ======


**Old Testament Times** 


Jewish Marriages in OT times were usually arranged by the father and a bridal price (mohar) was paid by the father of the groom for the bride. Other gifts were given to the bride (mattan). This is shown by the servant of Abraham giving jewels, silver and gold to Rebekah to marry Issac and also to the family precious things (Genesis 24:53). Usually after the marriage was consummated, there were feasts which lasted at least 7 days. (Gen 29:27-28)


**New Testament Times** 


NT Jewish marriage consisted of two ceremonies. First was the betrothal which was a negotiation and signing of a marriage covenant. At the betrothal the two are considered legally married but sexual relations were not allowed until the wedding ceremony which would usually happen at a future date – usually six months or a year when all the terms of the contract are fulfilled. Usually the bride remained at the home of her father and after the wedding would move into the groom’s home. The bride and groom were considered to be legally married and to divorce took another written contract.


During the time of the betrothal the groom could pick a loyal friend to help the bride prepare for marriage. This loyal friend was called a “friend of the bridegroom” and this was how John the Baptist was referred to in John 3:29.


At the time of the wedding ceremony the bride and groom usually stand under a canopy for all to witness the wedding. When the marriage was consummated, then usually there was a feast typically lasting seven days. All guests were given special garments, and did no work. The parable in Matthew 22:11 refers to a man who did not wear wedding clothes (which were free) and thus was thrown out of the wedding.
