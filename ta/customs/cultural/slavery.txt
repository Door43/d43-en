**The Mosaic Law allowed for Israelites to be slaves in certain conditions: ** \\ 
1) A man might sell himself to pay off debt (Leviticus 25:25, Leviticus 25:39)\\ 
2) A man might sell his daughter to be a maidservant (Exodus 21:7)\\ 
3) If a man stole something and could not pay restitution, he could work off the debt by slavery. (Exodus 22:1,3)


**The Mosaic Law allowed for Israelites slaves to be freed:** \\ 
1) In the year of Jubilee. (Every 50 years all slaves were to be freed, land returned to their rightful owners, and there was to be no farming that year. Leviticus 25:10, 13)\\ 
2) Every 7th year all slaves would be freed. If the slave came in alone or with a wife they were free. If the slave had been given a wife and/or they had children they wife & children were not free to leave. If the man did not want to leave, he could have his ear pierced as a sign he was a bonded slave. (Exodus 21:2-6)\\ 
3) If the slave himself, uncle, nephew, cousin or any near relative could pay the owner for the original purchase price minus a fair wage for the number of years worked. (Leviticus 25:48-55).\\ 
4) A woman who had been sold by her father was not free to leave at the end of 6 years, or in the year of Jubilee if the owner was going to marry her himself, or to a member of his family. Else the woman’s family could redeem her.
