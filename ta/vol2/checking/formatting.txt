There are checks that you can do before, during, and after translation of a book of the Bible that will make the translation go much easier, look good, and be as easy to read as possible. The modules in this section give more information about the following topics.

==== Before Translating ====

The translation team should make decisions about the following issues before you start to translate.
  - Alphabet. See [[en:ta:vol2:checking:alphabet]].
  - Spelling. See [[en:ta:vol2:checking:spelling]].
  - Punctuation. See [[en:ta:vol2:checking:punctuation]].

==== While Translating ====

After you have translated several chapters, the translation team may need to revise some of these decisions to take care of problems that they discovered while translating. You can also do consistency checks in ParaTExt at this time to see if there are more decisions that you need to make about spelling and punctuation. 

==== After Finishing a Book ====

After finishing a book, you can check to make sure that all the verses are there, and you can decide on section headings. It is also helpful to write down ideas for section headings as you translate.
  - Versification. See [[en:ta:vol2:checking:verses]].
  - Section Headings. See [[en:ta:vol2:checking:headings]].
