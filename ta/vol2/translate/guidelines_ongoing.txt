===== Create Ongoing Translations =====

This module answers the question: What are ongoing translations?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_intro|The Qualities of a Good Translation]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines|Translation Guidelines]]

Bible translations should be ONGOING. Share the translation with others to see if they understand the meaning of the message.  Improve your translation with their input. Revising a translation to increase understanding and accuracy is a good idea.
  * Reviewers are needed who can read the translation and point to text that needs revision. 
  * Have people read the translation or listen to a recording of the translation.  This will help you know if the translation has the same impact in your community that it had among the original audience (for example: giving comfort, encouragement or guidance).  
  * Continue to make corrections to the translation that will provide the same meaning as the source text.
Remember, encourage the review of the translation to decide when a revision or new translation is needed.
