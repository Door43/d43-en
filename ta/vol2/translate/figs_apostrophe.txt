Apostrophe is a figure of speech in which a speaker turns his attention away from his listeners and speaks to someone or something that he knows cannot hear him. This calls his listener's attention to his feelings toward that person or thing. 

**Mountains of Gilboa, Let there not be dew or rain on you** (2 Samuel 1:21) - King Saul was killed on Mount Gilboa, and David sang a sad song about it. By telling the mountains that he wanted them to have no dew or rain, he showed how sad he was.
===== Description =====
Apostrophe is a figure of speech in which a speaker turns his attention away from his listeners and speaks to someone or something that he knows cannot hear him. This calls his listener's attention to his feelings toward that person or thing.

**Reason this is a translation issue:**  Many languages do not use apostrophe, and readers could be confused by it. They may wonder who the speaker is talking to.\\ 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Come now, you who are rich, cry out loud because of the miseries coming upon you.** (James 5:1)\\ 
James wrote to the church, which was made up of poor people, as if rich people could hear him, showing his anger about what rich people were doing. 

**The man of God cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, "Altar, altar, Yahweh says, ' ...  on you they will burn men's bones.' "** (1 Kings 13:2) \\
The man of God spoke as if the altar could hear him, but he really wanted the king, who was standing there, to hear him.
===== Translation Strategies =====
If apostrophe would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here is another option.
  - Have the speaker express his feelings toward the thing or idea without speaking directly to it. 
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
  
1. If this way of speaking would be confusing to your people, you may preserve the meaning of the apostrophe and let the speaker continue speaking to the people that are listening to him.\\
  * **The man of God cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, “__Altar, altar__, Yahweh says, ' … on __you__ they will burn men's bones.' “** (1 Kings 13:2) \\
    * "The man of God said, "This is what Yahweh says __about this altar__'…  They will burn men's bones on __it__.'"
