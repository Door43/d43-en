===== Apostrophe =====

This module answers the question: What is an apostrophe?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

In apostrophe, a speaker turns his attention from the people he is speaking to and makes an exclamation to someone who is not there with them. He could even speak to an imaginary person or a thing or idea that is treated as if it were a person (See [[:en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]].) In the Bible, it is often used in prophecy as prophets addressed nations who were not expected to read the book at that time.
(To clarify, this is a literary device, not a punctuation mark.)
===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * You may put the name of the one being spoken to first, to show that the speaker has drawn his attention away from his primary audience to another audience.
  * Some languages have a marker that shows that someone is being spoken to. For example, English speakers used to use "O" before saying the name of the one they were talking to as in "O Moab" and "O forest."
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**__Jerusalem, Jerusalem,__  that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her!…**  Luke 13:34a (WEB) \\ 
Jesus made this exclamation to the people of Jerusalem as if they were there listening to him. But he was outside the city, and the people of the city were not there listening to him. And some of what he said was addressed to people who had lived long ago and were no longer alive. In this way, he expressed his deep sadness about the people of Jerusalem.\\ 
\\ 
**__Death__, where is your sting? __Hades__, where is your victory?**  1 Cor 15:55 (WEB) \\ 
Paul was speaking to death as if it were a person and challenging it, because death will not have any power to harm people.
===== Examples from English =====
__Silly dog,__  what are you barking for now?\\ 
\\ 
__Pesky phone__, why will you not let me call?
