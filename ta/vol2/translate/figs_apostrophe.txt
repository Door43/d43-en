===== Apostrophe =====

This module answers the question: What is an apostrophe?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

This module is about the literary device called "apostrophe," not the punctuation mark with the same name.

Apostrophe is a figurative way of speaking or writing in which the speaker turns his attention from the people he is speaking to and makes an exclamation to someone who is not there with them. He could even speak to an imaginary person or a thing or idea that is treated as if it were a person (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]].) In the Bible, it is often used in prophecy as prophets addressed nations who were not expected to read the book at that time. The speaker says something to someone or something that is not there as a way to let his audience understand his attitude toward that person or thing.

===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * You may put the name of the one being spoken to first, to show that the speaker has drawn his attention away from his primary audience to another audience.
  * Some languages have a marker that shows that someone is being spoken to. For example, English speakers used to use "O" before saying the name of the one they were talking to as in "O Moab" and "O forest."
  * If this way of speaking would be confusing to your people, you may preserve the meaning of the apostrophe and let the speaker continue speaking to his audience. See the example of 1 Cor 15:55 in the UDB, below.
  
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**__Jerusalem, Jerusalem__, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to you…**  Luke 13:34a (ULB) \\ 
Jesus made this exclamation to the people of Jerusalem as if they were there listening to him. But he was outside the city, and the people of the city were not there listening to him. And some of what he said was addressed to people who had lived long ago and were no longer alive. In this way, he expressed his deep sadness about the people of Jerusalem.\\ 
\\ 
**__O death__, where is your victory? __O death__, where is your sting?"**  1 Cor 15:55 (ULB) \\ 
Paul was speaking to death as if it were a person and challenging it, because death will not have any power to harm people. The UDB preserves the meaning of the apostrophe and states it in a direct way:
"Death will never win again! The pain of dying has been taken away!" 1 Cor 15:55 (UDB) 

===== Examples from English =====
__Silly dog,__  what are you barking for now?\\ 
\\ 
__Pesky phone__, why will you not let me call?
