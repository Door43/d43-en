===== Deictic =====

This module answers the question: What is a deictic?\\
Deictics are a word or phrase whose meaning depends on the time, place, and speaker; it depends on the context.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * It is important that the translator understands the context of the source text. 
  * The translator makes sure the target language text indicates the same contexts (people/places/times) as in the original. 
    * Sometimes, this may mean that a change in part of speech is necessary in order to be clear. For example, a pronoun may need to be translated as a proper noun used earlier in the text. 
    * Occasionally, the word order of the text may need to be altered to make the target language text clear.
===== Examples in the Bible =====
//Psalm 122:1-2//\\ 
**I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.**\\ 
"they" refers to someone from a previous passage; the end of the direct communication is marked by a difference location: David, the writer of Psalm 122, is not in Jerusalem.
//Psalm 2:7//\\ 
**I will tell the promise that he made to me: “You are my son, because today I have begotten you".**\\ 
Here, the pronoun changes, from 'he' to 'I' and 'me' to 'you', showing a change in speaker from David to God.
===== Example in English  =====
**"I am here now."** \\ 
Out of context, we don't know who "I" refers to, where "here" is, or when I am here. I could be male or female, here could be Jakarta, Indonesia or Los Angeles, United States. Now could be August 7, 1982 or April 21, 2015. This sentence alone doesn't give us enough information to clarify this.
