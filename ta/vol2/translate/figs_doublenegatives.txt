===== Double Negatives =====

This module answers the question: What are double negatives?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

Most languages express the negative near the verb. Some languages can also express negative in a pronoun like “none,” “nothing,” and “no one,” or an adverb like “nowhere.” In English the following pairs of sentences mean the same thing. “I do __not__ have any” – “I have __none__”. “I do __not__ want anything” – “I want __nothing__”.\\ 
\\ 
In some languages people use both negatives in one sentence. This is a kind of double negative. Sometimes this is simply the normal way of expressing the negative, and sometimes it emphasizes the negative. The following Spanish sentence “__No__ ví a __nadie__.” has both the word 'no' next to the verb and 'nadie' that means “no one.”  It emphasis the negative.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
When translating an English sentence that has “not” and a pronoun, or that has a negative pronoun like “none,” some languages may need to use both their word for “not” and their negative pronoun, as in the Spanish example above.\\ 
\\ 
When translating a sentence that has “not” and a negative adjective such as “She was __not un__attractive,” you will need to understand what it was intended to mean. If people would correctly understand the intended meaning with the double negative, you could use the double negative in your language.\\ 
\\ 
However, if people would not understand the double negative correctly, you could translate it without "not" and "un". If it simply means that she she was not plain-looking, it could be translated as “She was attractive.” \\ 
\\ 
Sometimes people use this kind of double negative to say that the opposite is very true. For example, "It is not unlikely" could mean "It is very likely." In this case, it is a figure of speech called [[:en:ta:translate:litotes|Litotes]]. But if it is an example of a Litote and the speaker was emphasizing how attractive she was, it could be translated as “She was very attractive” or "She was beautiful."
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Titus 3:14** //Our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that meet urgent needs so that they may __not__ be __un__fruitful.//\\ 
\\ 
**"So that they may not be unfruitful"** is a double-negative. It could be stated positively: “so they will be fruitful” or “so they can produce fruit for God” or “so their lives will be useful.”
===== Examples from English =====
A double negative can also be when a sentence has “not” and a negative prefix like “un” on an adjective, as in the words "unhappy" and "unlikely." Sometimes people use these simply to say that something is not true. For example, “It is not unlikely” may simply mean “It could happen.”
