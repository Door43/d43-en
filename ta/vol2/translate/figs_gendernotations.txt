Gender means making a distinction between the masculine, feminine and neutral nouns.  The English language does not make a distinction in noun gender the way some languages do. Instead, any gender markings (such as pronouns) take the natural gender of the object.

"Whomever" is neither masculine nor feminine. The same is true for 'it'; however, 'it' is not a word English uses for people.

Sometimes English uses "them/themselves" as a gender neutral marking; however, this changes the number of the noun from singular to plural.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

Many languages of the world mark gender for all nouns (whether or not they have a natural gender) and this gender marking does not always align with the object's natural gender.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock.  (Matt 7:24 NLT)

>Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it. What good will it be for a man, if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?'"  (Matt 16:24-26 NIV)

==== Examples from English ====

English has two gender-specific //3rd Person Singular Subject Pronouns// that depend on the sex of the individual referenced.
  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Masculine Pronoun: //**he **- refers to a male person
  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Feminine Pronoun: //**she **- refers to a female person
English has one gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun;//  however, it can only refer to non-human things.
  * //3rd Person Singular Non-human Pronoun//: **it**  - refers to a singular thing
