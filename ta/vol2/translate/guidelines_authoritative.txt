An authoritative translation is one that is based on the original language biblical texts as the highest authority for the meaning of biblical content. Whenever two or more translations of the Bible disagree about the meaning of a Bible passage, it is the original languages that have the final authority for deciding the meaning. Sometimes people are very loyal to certain Bible translations that they are used to reading, and might argue with other people who are loyal to a different Bible translation. But neither of those Bible translations are the highest authority, because they are only translations of the original. All translations are secondary in authority to the original languages. That is why we must always refer to the original biblical languges when deciding how to translate the Bible.

Since not all translation teams have a member who can read the original languages of the Bible, it is not always possible to refer to the biblical languages when translating the Bible. Instead, the translation team has to rely on translations that they are able to read that have, in turn, been based on the biblical languages. Many of the translations in the Gateway Languages were translated from the biblical languages, including the ULB, but some are translations of translations. It is easy for errors to be introduced when a translation is two or three steps removed from the original. To help with this problem, the translation team can do three things.
  - The translation team must use translationNotes, translationWords, and any other translation helps they have to help them translate in the best way. These translation helps were written by Bible scholars who know the original biblical languages.
  - They should compare their translation with as many other reliable translations as they can, to make sure that it is communicating the same message as the others.
  - Someone who has studied the biblical languages should review the translation to make sure that it is accurate. This person could be a church leader, pastor, seminary professor, or Bible translation professional.

Sometimes Bible translations differ because some passages in the Bible are unclear or ambiguous in the original biblical languages. In that case, the translation team must choose between them based on what Bible scholars say in translationNotes, translationWords, the UDB, and other translation helps.

Being AUTHORITATIVE when translating the Bible is: Using reliable sources, determine the order of events, either logically or according to time. If they differ from the order in which they were presented in the original, rearrange them in your language to best communicate the meaning intended in the original language.

For a clear understanding of the text, refer to your Biblical resources such as the Translation Notes, Important Words and the Unfolding Word Dynamic Bible that explain the meaning of the source languages.

There are guidelines to follow:
  * Reorder events only if necessary.
  * Pay attention to the message of the source text
  * Do not paraphrase, and
  * Translate the meaning of the source text

Reorder events only if necessary:

Read different versions to see if clauses and phrases have been rearranged to show the actual order of events. You should translate them in the order in which they occur. Be sure not to change the meaning of the scripture. Also see the lesson on [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_events]]. 

Consider Revelation 5:2:
>Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?  (ULB)

Compare:
>"The person who is worthy to break the seals of the scroll and then to open it should come to do it!"  (UDB)

Which version is clearer?

Your language also has its own structure for clear understanding.  You may need to rearrange phrases to put thoughts into a logical order for your language.  Remember to keep the meaning of the original author.  In some versions you will see that sometimes two verses run together, and the content is re-arranged within them. This is okay as long as there is no change in meaning, and the re-ordering offers a clearer and more accurate translation.  The UDB sometimes does this.

For example, in Mark chapter 6, verses 8 and 9 are combined and rearranged in the translation.

He also instructed them to wear sandals and to take along a walking stick when they were traveling. He told them not to take food, nor a bag in which to put supplies, nor any money for their journey. He also did not allow them to take extra clothing.

Compare this with the ULB and notice the differences.

>and he instructed them to take nothing for their journey but a staff. They should take no bread, no beggar's bag, and no money in their belts, but to wear sandals, and not to wear two tunics.

**Only combine or re-order verses occasionally**, when necessary to avoid wrong meaning or confusion;  Normally more than two verses should not be combined. Be careful when reordering longer passages.

**Pay attention to the message of the source text.**

Try to not concentrate on just the words of the message. Think about why God wanted each scripture included and what God is trying to tell or teach from the message.

**Do not paraphrase.**

Sometimes a translator changes the text so much that important information is left out. This is a paraphrase.  It is important to keep all important ideas and words found in the source text in the target language text.

The final guideline is to **convey thoughts and intent behind the ULB source text as close as possible**.  Only make changes from the literal where needed so that the translation is clear to understand. Keep the original authority of God’s word whenever possible.

Remember these are guidelines to follow:
  * Reorder events only if necessary.
  * Pay attention to the message of the source text
  * Do not paraphrase, and
  * Translate the meaning of the source text

Remember, use the source literal biblical texts as the highest authority on translation of biblical content.
