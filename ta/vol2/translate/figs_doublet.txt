===== Doublet =====

This module answers the question: What is a doublet?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

A **doublet** states the same thought in two ways–typically, as a way to reinforce the concept. In the Bible, doublets are often used in poetry, prophecy, and sermons.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * Translate only one of the doublet expressions without changing the meaning of the message.
  * When a doublet is used in poetry, a sermon, or prophecy, either keep the doublet, or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in poetry, sermons, and prophecies.
  * When the doublet is used in a story (a narrative text), either keep the doublet or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in narrative.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Make ready the way of the Lord!\\
Make his paths straight!** Mark 1:3b (WEB)\\
This is a doublet. Both commands mean the same thing.\\ 
\\ 
**For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known;\\
neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.** Mark 4:22 (WEB)\\ 
\\ 
**But he went out, and began to proclaim it much,\\
and to spread about the matter …**Mark 1:45 (WEB)\\
This is a doublet. "Proclaim it much" and "spread about the matter" mean basically the same thing.
