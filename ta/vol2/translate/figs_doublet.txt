====== Doublet ======

We are using the word **doublet** to refer to two words or very short phrases that mean the same thing and that are joined with the word "and." This is often used to emphasize or intensify the idea expressed by the two words.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Translate both words.
  * Translate only one of the words and add a word that intensifies it such as "very" or "great" or "many."
  * Use your own culture's way of emphasizing or intensifying the concept.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**King David was __old__ and __advanced in years__.** 1 Kings 1:1 \\ 
This means that he was "very old."

**he attacked two men __more righteous__ and __better__ than himself** 1 Kings 2:32 \\ 
This means that they were "much more righteous" than he was.

**You have decided to prepare __false__ and __deceptive__ words** Daniel 2:9 \\ 
This means that they had prepared "many false things to say".

**Then Daniel replied with __prudence__ and __discretion__** Daniel 2:14 \\ 
This means that he replied with "great prudence" or "very prudently".

**as of a lamb __without blemish__ and __without spot__.** 1 Peter 1:19 \\ 
This means that he was like a lamb that had "no blemish at all".
