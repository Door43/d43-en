**Purposes of Synecdoche**\\ 
1) When something is called by one of its parts, it is not a random part that is chosen. It is usually a part that is significant to what is being said about the thing or it is a part that is very prominent and people are very aware of.\\ 
2) When something is called by some bigger thing that it is a part of, it is usually because there is something significant about that bigger thing. But sometimes it is simply a shorthand way of referring to it.
