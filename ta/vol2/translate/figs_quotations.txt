===== Speech Quotations =====

**This page answers the question:** //What are speech quotations?//

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:
  * //[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech|English Parts of Speech]]//

Watch the video for the [[http://youtu.be/oe9Pbk8pFTw|computer]] (http://youtu.be/oe9Pbk8pFTw) or the [[http://youtu.be/9ZKDMCWuCiw|tablet/phone]] (http://youtu.be/9ZKDMCWuCiw).
In English there are direct and non-direct (indirect) quotations.
  * **DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports someone else’s speech the way the other person would have said it. (She said, “Come.” and then he said, “I will come.”) Direct quotations are written between quote marks “ ”.
  * **INDIRECT**  or **NON-DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports basically what another person said but from his own perspective (his own words). (She told him to come. He said he would come.) The pronouns change, and often there is a change in the verb tense. Indirect quotations are written without quote marks “ ”.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
Some languages have more than one kind of **NON-DIRECT ** quotations. If that is true of your language, consider the best non-direct quotation you should use.  Remember that **DIRECT** quotes in the source text should be direct quotes in the translated text. Perhaps your language organizes the sentence differently, you should then organize the sentence to keep the direct quote.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
Luke 5:14 has an example of an indirect quote and a direct quote in the same verse:
  * //He instructed him to tell no one// is an indirect quote.
  * //He told him, "Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest."//is a direct quote.
Luke 17:20 is another example where there is an indirect quote and a direct quote in the same verse:
  * //"Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come"//is an indirect quote.
  * //Jesus answered them and said, "The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed."//This// //is a direct quote.
===== Examples from English =====
//**Direct Quotations** //
  * John said, “I am reading a book.”
“I am reading a book” is a direct quotation, as it is the words John spoke. The word “I” refers to John, not to the person reporting what John said.
//**Indirect Quotations** //
  * John said that he was reading a book.
The phrase “that he was reading a book” is an indirect quotation as someone else is reporting what another person said.
===== Examples from other languages =====
Some languages require special markers that indicate what evidence a speaker has for what they are saying. These can range from being a witness, to being directly told (quoted speech), to being indirectly told (reported speech), to heresay, or inference.

From Lezgian, a language spoken in Azerbaijan and Russia

Qe sobranie že-da-**lda**

today meeting be-fut-**quot**

**'They say** that there will be a meeting today'

The marker -lda announces that this is reported speech.
