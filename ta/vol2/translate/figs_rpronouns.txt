===== Reflexive Pronouns =====

This module answers the question: What are reflexive pronouns?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech|English Parts of Speech]]

Reflexive pronouns refer back to a noun or pronoun that has already been mentioned in a sentence. In English **the reflexive pronouns** are: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves. 
===== Functions of Reflexive Pronouns =====
Reflexive Pronouns function in three different ways in English, that is, they do three different things:
  - Reflexive pronouns refer to a person or thing that has already been mentioned in the sentence.  For example, in the sentence "I saw myself in the mirror” the word "myself" refers back to "I" and in the sentence ”The man bought a new shirt for himself,” the word "himself" refers back to the "the man." 
  - Reflexive pronouns can emphasize a person or thing in the sentence. A speaker may use a reflexive pronoun in this way because the person or thing may be doing something that the listener might not expect. This may also imply that the person or thing contrasts with something else.  For example, "Mary herself bought the food" emphasizes that it was Mary who did it, not someone else. Using a reflexive pronoun in this way is very common when correcting someone. For example, someone might say, "I think that Mary's father bought the book for her." A response might be, "No, Mary bought the book __herself__."
  - Reflexive pronouns can state that someone did something alone or without help. For example, "Frank read the book by himself" could mean that Frank did it alone or that he did it without any help. The context will show which meaning is intended.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
  - Consider how your language indicates that something has already been referred to. Some languages may add something to the personal pronoun (as in English) or they may add a word to some other part of the sentence.\\
  - Languages have different ways of showing that a certain person or thing is being emphasized. They may or may not use a reflexive pronoun to do this. English also has other ways to show emphasis on a person or thing. “Jim __himself__ paid the debt.” can be translated as, “It was Jim who paid the debt” or “Jim is the one who paid the debt” or “The one who paid the debt is Jim.” “Yesterday, Jim saw the king __himself__” can be translated as,  “Yesterday, it was the king that Jim saw” or “Yesterday, Jim //actually// saw the king.”\\
  - The idiom "by myself" could be translated as "alone," "only," or "without help," depending on the context. “Bob went to the city __by himself__” can be translated as “Bob went to the city //alone//” or “//Only// Bob went to the city" or "Bob went to the city //without any help//," depending on the context. 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
 - **To refer to a person or object that has already been mentioned:**\\
John 5:31  If **I** should testify about **myself** alone, my testimony would not be true.
John 11:55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and **many** went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to purify **themselves**.
 - **To emphasize a person or thing in the sentence:**\\
 John 4:1-3 Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John (although **Jesus himself** was not baptizing, but his disciples were), he left Judea and departed for Galilee. 
John 6:6 (Now Jesus said this to test Philip, for **he himself** knew what he was going to do.)
 - **To state that someone or something was alone or did something alone or without help:** \\ 
John  6:15 //When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again up the mountain **by himself**.
John 20:7 and the face cloth that had been on his head; it was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in its place **by itself**. //
