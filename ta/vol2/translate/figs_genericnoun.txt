>So is __the man who goes into his neighbor’s wife__;
>__the one who has relations with her__ will not go unpunished. (Proverbs 6:28 ULB)
The underlined phrases above do not refer to a specific man. They refer to any man who does these things.

This does not refer to a particular man, but to any person who refuses to sell grain. 
>Yahweh gives favor to __a good man__, but he condemns __a man who makes evil plans__. (Proverbs 12:2 ULB) \\
