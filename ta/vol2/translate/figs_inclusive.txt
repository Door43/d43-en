Not all languages have “inclusive” pronouns. If a language has two sets of pronouns for “we,” “us,” and “our,” choosing the correct word requires a clear understanding of who is being referred to by the pronoun.  Inclusive pronouns refer to the speaker, the person(s) being spoken to and possibly others as well. These pronouns are called “inclusive” because, in addition to the speaker, they include the person(s) listening. Exclusive pronouns are those which refer only to the speaker and a select group of individuals–not those to whom the comments are addressed.

===== Translation Suggestions =====
This is not a problem for translators whose language also does not have inclusive pronouns. When a translator sees the word “us,” they can use the word for “us” in their own language. But translators whose language has separate inclusive pronouns will always have to be careful whenever they read words like “we” “us” and “ours.” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will always have to figure out whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
  * … the shepherds said one to another, “Let __us__  go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to __us__.” Luke 2:15 (WEB)
//The shepherds were speaking to one another. When they said “us”, they were including the people they were speaking to - one another.//
  * Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let __us__  go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth. Luke 2:22 (ASV)
//When Jesus used the pronoun “us,” he was referring to himself and to the disciples he was speaking to.//
