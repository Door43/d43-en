//This page answers the question:// //What is some important information about English grammar that I should know?//

==== Active or Passive ====

The English language has the active and passive form of speech.

  * In the ACTIVE form, the subject does the action.
  * In the PASSIVE form, the action is done to the subject.

Go to [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] for more information.

==== Exclusive ====

Some languages have two sets of pronouns for “we” “us” and “our”. The exclusive pronouns refer only to the speaker and at least one other person, but not the person being spoken to. They exclude the person being spoken to.

Go to [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]] or watch a video for computer (see http://youtu.be/W6m0Wi5y9Po ) or tablet/phone (see http://youtu.be/4oAnEMimBXE ) for more information.

==== Inclusive ====

Some languages have two sets of pronouns for “we” “us” and “our”. The inclusive pronouns refer to the speaker and the person or people he is talking to, and possibly others as well. These pronouns are called “inclusive” because, in addition to the speaker, they include the person being spoken to.”

==== Forms of You ====

=== Singular, Plural or Dual ===

English has only two forms of 'you.' Plural and singular. Some languages have plural, singular and dual forms of you.

For more information regarding Singular forms of you, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_yousingular]].

For more information regarding Dual / Plural forms of you, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]].

Watch the video for Singular / Dual / Plural on computer (see http://youtu.be/cPtjzJ2Advk ) or tablet/phone (see http://youtu.be/AVITfDEk8nc).

=== Formal or Informal ===

The Formal 'You' is used when addressing someone in authority. The Informal 'You' is used when talking with a peer or someone with less authority. Most languages that make this distinction will use the formal form for strangers or people one does not know very well and/or to show respect to people of higher status.

==== Speech Quotations ====

In English there are direct or non-direct, or indirect, quotations.
  * DIRECT quotations are when the words that were said originally are used. (She said, “Come.” and then he said, “I will come.”)
  * INDIRECT or NON-DIRECT quotations are when the original words are changed. (She told him to come. He said he would come.) The quote marks ” ” are not used and often there is a change in the verb tense.
