===== Personification =====

This module answers the question: What is personification?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

Personification is giving attributes human characteristics to a non-human object (i.e. thing, idea or animal).  Personification helps a writer to make something more vivid or life-like. It adds depth to writing and helps the reader 'feel' the subject matter more fully. 
===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * If the personification would be understood correctly, use it.
  * Using the words "like" or "as" can help clarify that this is a figure of speech, as in 1 Thessalonians 5:4, "that the day should overtake you __like__  a thief"
  * If it wouldn't be understood correctly, find a way to translate it without the personification. For example, "The wisdom of God said" could be translating as "God in his wisdom said."
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Therefore also __the wisdom of God said__, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,** Luke 11:49 (WEB)\\ 
Here God's wisdom is personified as if it could speak.\\ 
\\ 
**No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. __You can’t serve both God and riches.__** Matthew 6:24.\\ 
Here riches is personified as a master whom people might serve. 
===== Examples from English =====
**That delicious looking dessert is calling out to me, "Eat me. Eat me."** This personification helps to show how tempted the speaker feels to eat the cake. It also implies that the responsibility for the speaker's choice to eat the cake belongs to the cake.\\ 
\\ 
**The raging fire devoured everything in its way.** \\
This description of the fire helps show how terrifying and destructive it was by comparing it to a wild animal that devours other animals.
