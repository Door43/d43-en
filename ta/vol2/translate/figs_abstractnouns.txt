Remember that **//nouns//** are by definition a person, place, thing or idea. **ABSTRACT NOUNS** involves experiencing ideas that cannot be seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched in a physical sense. <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Ideas and things like 'peace' are equally real, but can not be seen or touched in a physical sense.</font>
===== Translation Suggestions =====
**ABSTRACT NOUNS** are powerful tools that present unique problems. For abstract nouns it is important to understand the culture in Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek. It is also important to be aware of a reader's likely understanding of a concept. In addition to the careful selection of abstract nouns, the use of related concrete nouns helps to make the meaning clear.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
Luke 19:8-10 //Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I will restore four times the amount." 9 Jesus said to him,\\ 
"Today//** salvation**// has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the people who are lost."// 
\\ 
Salvation is an abstract noun. The phrase, "salvation has come to this house" can be translated with the verb 'save': “God has saved this household.”
===== Examples from English =====
English uses common word endings (suffixes) that may help identify abstract nouns. They include such endings as: -tion; -ism; -ity; -ment; -ness; -age; -ance; -ence; -ship; -ability; -acy
  * For example, the word "child" is a concrete noun. A child is a touchable being. Childhood, though, is not something which can be touched and is a concept that relates to children. "Childhood" is an //abstract noun//.
  * Another example is 'son.' Son is a concrete noun that describes an individual. “Sonship” is an abstract noun that refers to the essence of the relationship of being a son.
  * Other abstract nouns point directly to ideas, attitudes, emotions or characteristics. Goodness, contentment and justice are examples of those types of abstract nouns.
