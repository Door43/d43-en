===== Equal Translations =====

**This page answers the question:** //What is an equal translations?//

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:

When translating the Bible:

Ensure that any EXPRESSIVE meaning comes across similarly in the target language as it does in the source language. Especially notice the forms in the source text that communicate certain kinds of emotions, and choose forms in the target language that communicate the same emotions. Examples of some of these forms follow.

=== Idiom ===

Determine the meaning of difficult idioms, proverbs and figures of speech and translate them with meaningful expressions in your language.  Usually idioms cannot be translated literally into another language. The meaning of the idiom has to be expressed in a way that is natural in the other language. \\ 
\\  
Here are three translations, all with the same meaning, of Acts 18:6:  

   * “Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent . . . ”  (RSV) 
   * “If you are lost, you yourselves must take the blame for it! I am not responsible . . . ” (GNB) 
   * “If God punishes you, it is because of you, not me!” (TFT)

These are all accusations of guilt. Some are using idioms with the word “blood” or “lost,” while the third is more direct using the word "punishes." In order for your translation to be equal, it must also express an accusation, and may use an idiom, as long as both the form of the accusation and the idiom are appropriate for the target language and culture. 

=== Figure of Speech ===

A figure of speech is a special way of saying something in order to catch the attention or express an emotion about what is said. Often the meaning of a figure of speech is different from the literal meaning of the words. The meaning is not intended to be taken literally. 

Here are some examples:\\  

**I was shattered!**   The speaker was not literally broken into pieces, but he felt very bad. \\ 

**He closed his ears to what I was saying.**  Meaning, “he chose to not listen to what I was saying.”\\ 

**The wind moaned in the trees.** This means that the wind blowing through the trees sounded like a person moaning.\\ 

**The whole world came to the meeting.**  Everyone in the world did not attend the meeting. Most likely there were many people at the meeting.\\ 

Each language has different kinds of figures of speech. The important thing is that you can:\\  

(1) recognize that a figure of speech is being used, \\ 
(2) recognize its purpose, and \\ 
(3) know the real meaning. \\ 

It is the __**real meaning**__ that should be translated into your language, not the meaning of the individual words.  \\ 

 
Some of the purposes for which figures of speech may be used:\\ 

(1) For emphasis;\\ 
(2) To indicate the attitude of the speaker;\\ 
(3) To catch the attention of the hearer;\\ 
(4) To produce an emotional response in the hearer; for example: surprise, disapproval, sympathy.\\ 
(5) For stylistic variation.\\

=== Rhetorical Questions ===

**[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical questions]]** are another way that the speaker captures the attention of the reader. Rhetorical questions are a type of questions that do not expect an answer or ask for information.  They can be intended as a rebuke, a warning, or to express surprise.  \\ 
 
All languages use questions. But questions are used for different purposes. The most usual purpose for which a question is used is to ask for information. The person asking the question expects an answer:\\ 
\\ 
Look at Mark chapter 6 verse 38.  “And he said to them, ‘How many loaves have you?’”  Answer:  “Five, and two fish.”\\ 
\\ 
This is an example of a REAL question, a question that expects an answer (although it may not necessarily receive one.)  But sometimes questions are used for other purposes:\\ 
\\ 
Such as Mark chapter 8 verse 36.  “For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?”\\ 
\\ 
Here no answer is expected. The speaker is not asking for information, he is emphasizing a point: it is no advantage at all to a man to gain possession of the whole world, if by doing so he loses his life.  This is an example of a RHETORICAL question.  A RHETORICAL question does not ask for information.  It has some other purpose.\\ 
\\ 
You may need to restate a rhetorical question as a statement when you translate.  Remember, be sure to keep the same purpose and meaning as the original rhetorical question had.  \\ 
\\ 
**REMEMBER:**  \\ 
Communicate the feelings and attitudes of the original text.  Translate them into forms that communicate in a similar way in your language. Consider how that meaning can best be ACCURATELY, CLEARLY, EQUALLY, AND NATURALLY EXPRESSED in the Target Language.
