\\ 
To maintain HISTORICAL significance when translating the Bible means to: Include or refer to any implied meaning that has been assumed by the writer but that your community might not know.\\ 
\\ 
The Bible is a historical document. The books of the Bible were written down at specific times in history for people of a certain culture. It would be wrong to rewrite the Bible as if it were written in a different time and for a different people.\\ 
\\ 
Remember to keep:
  * True to the historical text. The original message, historical events, and cultural background information should all be the same as it was written in the source text. For example, the translation must not have the message rewritten so that events happened at a different place or time.
  * Communication clearly by expressing the message in such a way that the Target Language culture will be able to understand the meaning that the original author intended to communicate.

Events recorded in the Old Testament are common in the New Testament. Such references should be translated in a way that is as meaningful as possible, without expanding in a way that would twist or hide the main point of the original message.
Let us compare **1 Corinthians 10:1** from the ULB and UDB.\\ 
\\ 
//“I want you to know, brothers and sisters that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea. “ (ULB)//\\ 
\\ 
//“I want you to remember, brothers and sisters, that our Jewish ancestors were following God, who led them as a cloud during the day, as they passed through the Red Sea on dry land, long ago in the time of the Exodus.” (UDB)//\\ 
\\ 
Notice that the UDB makes several points explicit: the ‘fathers were all under the cloud’ tells of the time that God led the Jewish ancestors as a cloud. The statement that ‘our fathers passed through the sea’ is also about the ‘passing through the Red Sea in the time of the exodus.’ The translator decided to explicitly describe the historical events. This translation is more meaningful for those who have little knowledge of Old Testament history.\\ 
\\ 
Include or refer to the needed implicit information intended by the original writer that will be necessary for your community to understand what is written. \\ 
\\ 
Maintain the historical accuracy of the message.  Avoid referring to items and events that were not present in the Bible times.  Do not make your translation sound like it is a modern day event.\\ 
\\ 
Remember, communicate historical events and facts accurately. Provide additional information as needed to accurately communicate the intended message to people who do not share the same context and culture as the recipients of the original content.
