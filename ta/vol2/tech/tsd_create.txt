==== Create Translation Text ====

To write the translation in your language: 
  * Go to the story or book that is being translated.
  * In the **Chapter or Story** view, read the source text.
  * Click on the **Chunk** view to begin translating.
**Note:** The program is designed for using the process of blind drafting. You may want to read [[en:ta:vol1:translate:mast]] to understand the steps of blind drafting translation.
  * Click on the paper that is showing to the right of the source text chunk. Type in the translation for that chunk on the page. (Note the reference at the top of the chunk, just above the red line.)
    * Start translating using the blind draft process - Draft the chunk as well as you can without looking back at the text. Write everything that you remember about that chunk. Do not look back at the source text for this chunk until you begin the editing steps. Continue doing this with each chunk of the chapter before moving to the checking steps.
  * When you are finished working, click on or scroll to a different chunk.


==== Edit Translation Text ====

When you use translationStudio, you have the ability to create and change text. Use the **Chunk** or **Check** views to edit existing work that you or another translator created. Your work will be saved automatically every five minutes.

In the **Check** view the source text is on the left, the translation work is in the middle. If necessary, scroll from the left to the right side to show the resources for that chunk. Scroll up or down to move from chunk to chunk. The UDB and all of the translationNotes, translationWords and translationQuestions have been included in the translation helps. See [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_resources]] for more information.

After the translation has been thoroughly checked, move the verse markers to where they should be in the text. The verse markers are shaped like upside-down blue water droplets.

When you are finished working, use the slider at the bottom of the chunk to mark the translation of that chunk done. A message will appear for you to confirm that the chunk is done. Tap 'Confirm' to confirm that the work is done or 'Cancel' to continue working on the chunk.

==== Save Translation Text ====

Go to [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_backup]] to learn how to manually save the translation work to the computer.

Your work is not saved on unfoldingWord until you upload your work. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_d43publish]])

==== Delete Translation Text ====

If you accidentally delete a large amount of work, contact [[help@door43.org]].
