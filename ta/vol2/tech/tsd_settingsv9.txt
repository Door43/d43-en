Note: A blue square with a white check mark means that the option has already been chosen.

The decision to turn on the GL mode needs to be done before a project has been started. This decision needs to be made because of how the project file is named when saved. Please make sure that all your translators are creating projects from the same mode (GL on or off) if they want to combine the projects.
