After the translator has set-up the User Account they will need to agree to the Terms of Use.

unfoldingWord has a goal of making disciples of all nations by helping to provide unrestricted biblical content in every language of the world. There are three agreements that every translator must read, understand, and agree with. They are:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith]] - Work with people and organizations who have the same beliefs  
  * [[en:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines]] - Use a common translation theory
  * [[en:ta:vol1:intro:open_license]] - Release everything created under an open license

The first time you sign into the program you will see the **Terms of Use** screen.
   * You will need to read and agree with each of the statements and the Terms of Use.
      * Click on each statement.
      * Read the entire statement.
      * Click on "Close" for each statement.
      * If these statements reflect your beliefs, click on the "I Agree" button.
Note: clicking on the "No Thanks" link will close the screen and open the Login screen.

You can view the License Agreement, Statement of Faith, Translation Guidelines and the Software Licenses information from the Settings Menu.
