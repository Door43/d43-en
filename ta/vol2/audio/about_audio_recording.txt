===== About Audio Recording =====

//This page answers the question:// //In what context does unfoldingWord engage audio recording?//

With nearly 140 years of history, audio recording is far from being a new invention. Over the years, certain truths have been discovered that have come to be considered “principles” of sound, many of these relating to the physics of sound. As principles were learned, inventors designed equipment to capture and reproduce sound with increasing faithfulness to the live sound source.

The type of audio recording we are thinking about in this manual does not happen in laboratory conditions of science halls or in a technical design room. Instead, it happens in a dynamic, diverse, real-world environment with each scenario a unique condition, each recording a unique, creative, human expression.

Real audio recording cannot be reduced to a technical or mechanical process. In truth, real audio recording is the craft of a creative artist applying wisdom, skills, proven principles and careful technique to the unique ingredients of the environment, the available tools and the characteristics of the people participating.

unfoldingWord understands this distinction and seeks to encourage and empower the global Church's new and existing audio recordists to become ever wiser and better skilled at their craft. Likewise, we are equally and always students of audio. So we eagerly look forward to what the global Church will continue to teach us and allow us to pass along in the free and open context.
