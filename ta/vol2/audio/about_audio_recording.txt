===== About Audio Recording =====

//This page answers the question:// //In what context does unfoldingWord engage audio recording?//

Having nearly a 140 year history, audio recording is far from being a new invention. Over the many years of development and experimentation, certain truths have been discovered that have come to be considered “principles” of sound, many of these relating to the physics of sound. As principles were learned, inventors steadily created technology designed to capture and reproduce sound in varying degrees of faithfulness to the live sound source.

The audio recording we are thinking about in this manual does not happen in laboratory conditions of science halls or in a technical design room. Instead, it happens in a dynamic, diverse real-world environment with each scenario a unique condition, each recording a unique, creative, human expression.

Real audio recording cannot be reduced to a technical or mechanical process. In truth, real audio recording is the craft of a creative artist applying wisdom, skills, proven principles and careful technique to the unique ingredients of th environment, the available tools and the characteristics of the people participating.

unfoldingWord understands this distinction and seeks to encourage and empower the global Church's new and existing audio recordists to become ever wiser and better skilled at their craft. Likewise, we are equally and always students of audio. So we eagerly look forward to what the global church will continue to teach us and allow us to pass along in the free and open context.
