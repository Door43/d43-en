===== Timeline Navigation =====

**This page answers the question:** ////How do I navigate the timeline?////

Proficiency in timeline navigation and zoom function

If there is one skill that greatly improves your effectiveness as an audio editor, it is the ability navigate quickly throughout the recorded audio file, quickly zooming in/out the viewable area to aid in effective assessment of the waveform and for good precision in selecting sections and making changes to that section (copying, pasting, deleting, changing amplitude, etc). Good audio editing software will allow you fast and effective navigation and zoom functionality by using the mouse scroll-wheel.
