===== Timeline Navigation =====

//This page answers the question:// //How do I navigate the timeline?//

If there is one skill that greatly improves your effectiveness as an audio editor, it is the ability navigate quickly throughout the recorded audio file. Over time you will gain proficiency at quickly zooming in/out of the viewable area for effective assessment of the waveform, for good precision in selecting sections and for making changes to that section (copying, pasting, deleting, changing amplitude, etc). Good audio editing software will allow you fast navigation and excellent zoom functionality by using the mouse and scroll-wheel.
