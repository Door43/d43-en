===== The Checker =====

This module answers the question: //What does the Checker do?//\\
==  ==

The checker is the teammate responsible to ensure that the narrator is communicating the words accurately. In this context, accuracy refers to several things. The narrator must speak the exact words that are approved as “the text” (written or oral translations). Those words must be pronounced correctly. And just as important, they must be spoken with the intonation and rhythm that accurately conveys the correct meaning.

In order to fulfill this responsibility well, the checker must be a native speaker of the language and well engaged in the life of the language community so as to have good judgment regarding accent, pronunciation, etc. In contrast, a person that speaks the language but has lived away from the language community, or has not been speaking the language regularly in the community context, would no longer have the best sense of accent and pronunciation.

In the case of recording a written text, the checker must have achieved proficiency as a reader of the language. They must be able to follow the text in real-time while listening to the recording.

A checker that is full of patience and encouragement will be a great blessing to the team. As mentioned before, narrating with precision is a difficult task. Any encouragement and support the checker can give will be much appreciated by the narrator. 

There will likely be many situations during a recording where the checker and narrator will need to assess a word or phrase for accuracy. The checker would do well to have a resource or two readily available to aid in confirming proper pronunciation of proper nouns or similar words that may appear in the text.
