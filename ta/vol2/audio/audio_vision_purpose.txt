===== Vision & Purpose =====

This module answers the question: //What is the vision and purpose of the audio handbook?//\\
===  ===

The vision of unfoldingWord Audio Engineering is to serve and equip the global Church to make and distribute excellent, unrestricted audio recordings of Biblical content, especially in sub-optimal conditions. The recommendations, skills-training and tips provided in this handbook are developed for, by and with the global Church as solutions to empower a world-wide team of media creators to lead their own projects with skill, excellence, wisdom and longevity for their own people groups.

Today, the need for Biblical content to be accessed audibly is as significant as any time in history. As much as 80% of all people live in oral culture communities. For people living in literate-based societies, many of them learn best, if not exclusively, by listening (aural learning). Billions of people need a solution engineered that can go the distance where conventional strategies and methods have limited effectiveness and restricted access.

This manual, like all unfoldingWord content, is licensed CC BY-SA to make it irrevocably accessible to the global Church. By combining these unrestricted resources, genuine skills-training, tremendous advancements in recording technology and versatile devices for offline listening and content sharing, it is our belief that the global Church can work together to meet this vast for access to Biblical content for the first time.
