===== Excellence =====

This module answers the question: //What is the excellence approach to audio?//\\
==  ==

Excellence in audio has many aspects. It refers to the what the quality of the audio enables for effective distribution – does it have the flexibility and versatility needed for various applications? It also refers to how a project is done in regard to relationships – did the work and interactions bring about positive things in God's family? A third aspect is considering if the best possible value was achieved for the language group both for the present time and for generations to come.

Some reasons for excellence:

  * The message of the Bible is the most valuable message in the world.
  * Every language group is equally valuable to God.
  * It maximizes listening longevity and format versatility across listening devices for years to come (mediocre recordings are limiting and can hit a quality threshold in useability before listener's needs are met.
  * It makes a project faster and better.
  * Fewer errors happen that require time fixing.
  * Everyone's time is spent more productively.
  * The team stress level is lower, which leads to a better overall experience and more meaningful relationships among the team.
  * It is easier to do things right the first time (there really are no shortcuts).


It is important to do the best quality work we can on each project, as ultimately we are serving the Lord (Romans 12:11, Colossians 3:23-24, Ecclesiastes 9:10). Part of striving to do our best includes being responsible to strengthen our skills and keep them sharp. Together, we can do this (Proverbs 27:17).
