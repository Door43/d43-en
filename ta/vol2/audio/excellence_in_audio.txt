===== Excellence =====

//This page answers the question:// //What is the excellence approach to audio?//

The excellence approach to audio has many aspects. It refers to what the recording quality enables for effective distribution. Does the quality allow for flexibility and versatility needed for various applications? Excellence also refers to how a project is done in regard to relationships. Does the project work and interactions bring about positive things among God's family? A third aspect of excellence is considering if the best possible value in audio content is being reached for the language group for the present time and for generations to come.

Some reasons for excellence:

  * The message of the Bible is the most valuable message in the world.
  * Every language group is equally valuable to God.
  * It maximizes listening longevity and format versatility across listening devices for years to come (mediocre recordings are limiting and can hit a quality threshold in usability before listener's needs are met).
  * It makes a project faster and better.
  * Fewer errors happen that would require additional time to fix.
  * Everyone's time is spent more productively.
  * The team's stress level is lower, which leads to a better overall experience and more meaningful relationships within the team.
  * It is easier to do things right the first time (there really are no shortcuts).


It is important to do the best quality work we can on each project, as ultimately we are serving the Lord (Romans 12:11, Colossians 3:23-24, Ecclesiastes 9:10). Part of striving to do our best includes being responsible to strengthen our skills and keep them sharp. Together, we can do this (Proverbs 27:17).
