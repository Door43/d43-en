===== Playback Monitoring =====

//This page answers the question:// //What is playback monitoring?//

Playback monitoring is the process of listening to a section of audio that has been recorded. This can be done using a variety of listening devices ranging from studio monitors (speakers), all-purpose speakers, headphones, earbuds or built-in speakers. Some pieces of monitoring equipment are better suited for the different types of listening described below.


==== General Listening ====

This kind of listening is done together by the team using studio monitors, an all-purpose speaker, earbuds or the device's built-in speakers. In this case, the audio quality is not being analyzed as much as simply reviewing the words for accuracy.


==== Critical Listening ====

Critical listening is something typically done by the recordist, but potentially also the entire team in some situations. In a critical listening scenario, the recordist is often using quality headphones to carefully analyze the audio. The recordist may do this to investigate if there is:
  * echo in the recording,
  * if an instance of background noise is noticeable in the recording, or
  * if an edit process was performed with precision
