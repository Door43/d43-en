===== Recording & Editing Software =====

This module answers the question: //What software do you recommend for recording and editing?//\\
===  ===

== Windows OS ==

  * **[[http://www.ocenaudio.com.br/|Ocenaudio]]** – Best free software for simple, efficient recording/editing. Intuitive interface and well-equipped for all basic voice recording tasks, recordists familiar with Adobe Audition will recognize and appreciate the speed and functionality of essential procedures in Ocenaudio. 

   * **[[http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html|Adobe Audition]]** – Best paid recording software for voice recording. New version (Adobe CC) can be expensive and user interface is far more complex than Ocenaudio. However, for advanced level editing Adobe Audition's included tools are impressive and can accomplish things free programs cannot begin to do. If a discontinued copy of Audition 3.0 is obtainable, users will find it to be the ideal balance of a simple, intuitive user interface and well-equipped tool set.

  * **[[http://audacityteam.org/download/|Audacity]]** – Free recording/editing software, yet cumbersome and lacking in design and UI features that enable productivity and efficiency when compared to Ocenaudio and Adobe Audition. However, it possesses many editing and audio restoration tools not found in Ocenaudio's basic editing toolset (although not of comparable quality to Adobe Audition) that advanced level recordists may find very useful. 
    * //**Notes:** The conventional save commands will save your recorded audio files in their proprietary format which is not useful. Be sure to use the “Export Audio” command to save files in compatible formats such as WAV (best quality) or MP3 (low quality). If you plan to edit or save files in mp3 format you will need to download and install this// [[http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#How_do_I_download_and_install_the_LAME_MP3_encoder.3F|MP3 Encoder]].
    

== Android OS ==
//Note: Audio quality results vary depending on device A/D convertors. See list of recommended tablets.//


  * **[[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nchsoftware.pocketwavepad_free&hl=enWavePad|WavePad Free]]** - WavePad Free is the best free audio recording/editing app for the Android platform and is equipped with the essential tools needed for efficiency in nearly any recording/editing task. Upgrading to paid version eliminates advertising, saving to MP3 format and several other tools and option.

  * **[[https://github.com/WycliffeAssociates/translationRecorder/releases|translationRecorder (tR)]]** – In early development stage. A simple recording and editing app with emphasis on intuitive function. Has marker cues, good file naming system and ability to save directly to microSD card. Very limited editing capabilities.
