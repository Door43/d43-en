===== Field Recording Environment =====

**This page answers the question:** ////What is a field recording environment?////

=== ===

We consider the field recording environment to be recording projects done outside of a room permanently dedicated or designed for the purpose of audio recording. Field recording includes the traditional concept of recording in a remote location, but would simply be defined as any temporary setup that creates a quality recording environment where a suitable one did not previously exist.
     
It is the our belief that field recording is how most recording of Biblical content will need recorded. It is often too expensive to build, maintain and staff fixed infrastructure and the high costs and logistical constraints of utilizing established, professionally designed studios can also be prohibitive. However, a field recording team is skilled, mobile and adaptable. A good field recording team enables recordings to happen where they need to happen.

====Skills & Ingenuity====

Often field recording requires much in the way of skills and ingenuity of the recording team, especially the recordist. The recordist needs to be able to assess the existing recording environment, detect elements that will negatively impact quality and identify locally-available solutions that will handle issues and help quality. In order to do this effectively the recordist needs to have a solid understanding of the behavior of sound waves in an environment and how to treat or avoid common issues.

====Simplicity====

Keeping the recording process and equipment setup simple is one of the smartest decisions that can be made in field recording. A simple kit of gear means it is easy to maintain, easy to setup, and there is less chance for problems, errors or delays. Skill at knowing how to use that gear very well will produce better results than having fancy gadgets.

====Adaptability====

Adaptability has as much to do with a resilient attitude as it does with the ability to adjust in areas of equipment, logistics or process. A team with proper skills-training and a simple gear setup //can// be adaptive when circumstances change and Plan A is no longer viable. The ability to create, adapt and succeed with excellence at Plan B or Plan C can often be necessary in field recording.

Advantages of a field recording can be:

  * Recording can be done in the best location possible considering all factors of project.
  * Ability to record at or near where language is spoken can make the difference in being able to record or not (cost and cultural advantages).
  * A team is assembled for the specific project, which can help increase focus and intentionality
  * Intentionality of recordist to select optimal equipment may lead to an easier recording and better quality
  * Intentionality of recordist to analyze and treat acoustical challenges can create an environment equal or better than any studio alternatives.

Disadvantages of field recording can be:

  * Nearly every factor of recording becomes a variable that the recordist must find a solution for.
  * Some locations can be extremely challenging to find an environment quiet enough for recoding.
  * There may be need to setup and pack away equipment and workspace every day, which reduces time spent recording.
