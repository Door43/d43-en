===== Editing =====

**This page answers the question:** ////What is editing?////

====  ====

Editing is the process of making corrections and modifications to a recorded file for the purpose of improving it in aspects such as accuracy, natural flow, volume fluctuation and removal of unwanted or distracting content. 

Editing is perhaps the most underestimated skill and component of a recording project. There is a well know principle held among experienced recordists, and that is “record with editing in mind”. The better the techniques used and the wiser the decisions made during the recording phase, the better the editing phase goes. In fact, a small poor decision during recording can greatly impact the amount of work required in the editing phase. However, some poor recording decisions cannot be corrected during editing regardless of the amount of time spent.
