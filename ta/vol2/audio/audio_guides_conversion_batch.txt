===== How to Convert File Format (Batch Process) =====

//This answers the question:// //Are there any guides that explain how to use the equipment and software?//

This guide describes how to convert audio file formats.

MediaHuman Audio Converter is a free software that makes it easy to create formats for distribution.

In the example below, we will show how to use MediaHuman Audio Converter to create MP3 files from a set of WAV files. We are going to chose to make standard quality MP3 files (44.1 kHz, 128kbps).


==== Step 1: Add files ====

Files can be added to MediaHuman Audio Converter in 2 ways. One option is to click on the + button to launch Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder with files you would like to convert. The other option is to simply select, drag and drop the files into the converter window.

From the drop-down menu boxes, select the desired format settings. In this example, we are selecting MP3 format, 44100Hz, 128kbps. By default, MediaHuman offers this setting in stereo format, even though our source files are mono. We can either leave the setting as stereo, or we can make a custom setting for mono by choosing "Custom" from the format settings.

Creating custom settings is easy and these settings will be remembered by MediaHuman for future conversion projects. To create custom settings for the format we are creating in this example, we would make the following selections.

  * Channels: mono
  * Sample rate: 44100Hz
  * Bitrate mode: CBR
  * Bitrate: 128
