===== Basic Acoustic Principles =====

This module answers the question: //What are basic acoustic principles?//\\
=== ===

One of the valuable steps towards recording with excellence is understanding basic concepts about the behavior of sound waves in a recording environment. A recordist with basic knowledge can make profound improvements in quality and clarity of the narration, often with very little investment of time, energy or material cost.

The first principle to know about acoustics is that, even though sound waves are invisible, their behavior is not unpredictable. In fact, their behavior can be easily explained, measured and calculated with using mathematical formulas. This is not something the average recordist will be interested in or need to calculate so we will not devote space toward it in this module. It is simply enough for most recordists to understand that there is an objective reason why sound behaves the way it does in a recording space and, with basic knowledge, they can be confident in knowing how to improve it.

The second principle to know about acoustics is that, in truth, when we take steps to improve the sound quality we are actually applying subtractive measures, not additive. In other words, we are in truth not making it sound better by adding new ingredients that are good. Instead we are making it sound better by decreasing ingredients that sound bad, thus allowing the good ingredients to be heard with clarity and comfort.

Often what we are really solving, or overcoming, by the subtractive improvement technique is to bring a more natural balance back to the sound that has been artificially impacted by recording environment. 

A third principle about acoustics is that sound waves contain energy and will stay active (producing noise) until there is something that depletes their energy to the level of being non-detectable for the human ear. Generally speaking, acoustical challenges are caused by physical conditions causing particular sound frequencies to stay strong, or even amplify, thus throwing off the desirable balance of frequencies. The dimensions of a recording space will impact the balance, or imbalance, of frequencies.

Virtually every type of material provides some degree of absorption of sound, which is something that may not be obvious. What we really need to know is how well a particular material absorbs certain frequencies. For example, a glass window is some what effective at absorbing low bass frequencies, but it is very poor at absorbing mid-range and high frequencies. Therefore, in a voice recording context, glass is not going to be a very useful treatment material because it does poorly at absorbing the frequencies that are problematic in voice recording. By contrast, a wool or cotton blanket, even a single layer of thickness, can provide a significant degree of sound absorption of troublesome mid-range and high frequencies.

Glass typically amplifies acoustical problems because it acts as a large, hard reflective surface to bounce sound waves back and forth with other hard surfaces, such as cement walls. Sounds waves reflecting off hard surfaces are perhaps the main acoustical challenge faced in voice recording. 

Deflection of sound waves is another technique to reduce reflections, yet it has less significant effect. Deflection is typically used more when trying to keep a controlled level of reflection. It is our opinion that for beginning recordists, deflection will not be the best technique and absorption should be the primary technique used. But anything that can be done to absorb or scatter (deflect) sound waves will be advantageous.

The last principle to know about acoustical challenges is that they must be tackled before you record, not after. There is a common assumption that software can fix acoustic issues in a recording. The reality is that somethings can be adjusted by software, but there are many acoustical issues that cannot be removed from a recording later. Any attempt to do major fixing will usually degrade the entire recording, including the good aspects that need to be preserved. This can be very expensive and time consuming for a minimum degree of effectiveness. The bottom line is that recordists need to solve acoustical issues on site before recording, not hope there will be expensive software and expert engineers able to fix it later.
