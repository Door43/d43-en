===== Studio Recording Environment =====

This module answers the question: //What is a studio recording environment?//\\
===  ===

The studio recording environment is a place where a significant level of investment and preparation has been made to create a permanent space with favorable conditions for recording projects to occur. 

Generally speaking a studio will have at least one room where adequate acoustical treatment has been done to improve sound quality. Most of this treatment is permanent, but some may be removable to allow greater flexibility for types of audio production a studio can accommodate.

Most studios will be equipped with all the basic equipment needed for voice recording, positioned in place and ready to use. Some studios may have additional equipment on hand for other types of audio production or, for example, to select a mic that is better matched for a narrator's voice.

Many studios will have some capacity for climate control and will be equipped with electrical power, perhaps even a battery backup system.

Studios will often have a staff that includes a manager, recordist, project coordinator or other essential roles supporting audio production in a studio environment.

Advantages of a studio can be:

  * A dependable, stabilized workspace with fewer variables to contend with during the process.
  * A room that has received acoustical treatment to improve suitability for recording (although not guaranteed to be adequate improvements – use your own ears to evaluate).
  * Equipment for audio recording in place and ready to use every day (although not guaranteed to be correct design for voice recording or functioning properly).
  * Experienced staff available for hire to aid in project (although not guaranteed to be proficient)

Disadvantages of a studio can be:

  * It is not mobile, so it may be a very long distance to travel for participants of a project.
  * Permanent infrastructure requires initial investment and ongoing maintenance.
  * In many cases, a continual income is typically needed to keep facility maintained and with staff employed to keep studio operation viable.
