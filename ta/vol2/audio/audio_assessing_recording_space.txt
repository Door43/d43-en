===== Assessing the Recording Space =====

This module answers the question: //How do I assess a potential recording space?//\\
===  ===

In most recording projects it is not feasible to expect that the recording space can be professionally analyzed by acoustical experts using calibrated measurement tools and diagnostic software. Instead the recordist is going to need to rely on their ears and their eyes as their best tools to assess a recording space. 

An easy way to give a potential recording space an initial assessment is to simply say a few phrases aloud and listen to how your voice sounds in the room. Does it sound clear and natural? Do you notice an echo? Does it sound like your voice has an unusual characteristic? Repeat this test in various locations in the room and facing in different directions. Do you find different results depending on where you stand or which direction you face? Is there a specific location and direction that sounds the clearest and most natural?

Once you identify the best location, the next step is to make some simple acoustical improvements to make the voice sound even better. 

How can we use our eyes to effectively assess the recording space and identify probable sources of acoustical problems? Even with just a small amount of training and experience, you can notice things that are acoustical challenges ready to happen. Bare cement walls and ceilings, tile floors, large glass windows, metal doors – these are physical materials that have a reputation for reflecting sound waves at a problematic level.

Before beginning to make acoustical improvements, there are few more aspects to evaluate about a potential recording space. Are there activities that typically occur in an adjacent room, on the floor above, or outdoors nearby? Is it possible that at certain times of the day or week the recording environment could be a drastically different situation than the exact time that you are assessing it? For example, an evening or weekend visit to assess a recording space may not give an accurate representation of what the ambient noise level is like during regular working hours.
