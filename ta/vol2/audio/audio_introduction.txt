====  ====

This unfoldingWord Audio Handbook is yours. We hope it will be a helpful companion in your audio projects, training and equipping you in the basic skills and wisdom you need to carry a project from start to finish.

We have divided the handbook into modules focused on various aspects of audio work. Toward the back we have included handy reference materials, “how-to” guides and more. The principles, skills and recommendations are carefully selected and continually evaluated to identify the best practices and optimized equipment for recording and for effective distribution of Biblical content in real-world conditions.

This handbook will be revised and updated occasionally. You can always find the latest version at https://unfoldingword.org.
