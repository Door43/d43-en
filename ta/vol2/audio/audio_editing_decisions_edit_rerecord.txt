===== Decisions - Edit or Re-record =====

**This page answers the question:** ////Is it better to edit or re-record?////

===  ===

With the conveniences of modern editing software, there is a danger to spend too much time editing a recording that should have been recorded better the first time. The idea that there are many editing tools available, some software capable of amazing precision-grade surgical editing, can easily lead a recordist to make poor decisions in the area of time management. Sophisticated editing should only been done if there is no good alternative. 

Most of the time, it is a much better decision to simply re-record a small section of audio. Consider a 1-minute section of audio. It took 1 minute to record it. It will take 1 minute to play it back when checking for quality. Any editing will quickly add time invested on that 1-minute piece of audio. Without good discernment about when to edit and when to re-record, 10 or even 15 minutes could go by trying to fix a small error that could have been re-record and resolved in less than a minute.

Most of the time a re-recorded section that does not need to be edited will be of much better quality that a section that required complex editing.

There will, of course be times when it makes sense to spend a little extra time editing. However, most of the time inexperienced recordists will spend too much time editing sections of audio that should be re-recorded. Do your best to be aware of this risk and strengthen your skills for assessing when to edit and when to re-record. 

Let's say, for example, that there are several small errors in that section. Should the recordist spend several minutes listening and attempting corrective measures on each small error? Would it be easier to immediately re-record?
