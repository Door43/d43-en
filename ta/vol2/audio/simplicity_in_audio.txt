===== Simplicity =====

**This page answers the question:** ////What is the simplicity approach to audio?////

==  ==

We recommend keeping things simple. It is easy for beginners and experienced recordists alike to become intrigued with all of the gadgets and digital processing available in audio recording today. However, keeping things simple and basic is not only our recommended approach, but also the wisest approach in nearly every recording scenario. In fact, things rarely go wrong when the equipment and process is kept simple. By contrast, every additional piece of equipment, adapters, processing steps, logistical complications, extra participants, etc. - all of these unnecessary elements increase the likelihood for errors, problems, project down time, stress and discouragement.

In regard to equipment, a basic setup will be the most reliable, each piece designed and tuned to do its task well. Every piece is compatible and no unnecessary pieces of equipment, cables or software processes are taking up space or creating the increased potential for problems.

In regard to the team, a small team that is committed to the project, understands their roles and works as a team will likely have excellence in their efforts. Having too many staff or participants involved can often introduce new complications to the project and decrease efficiency.
