===== Audio Markers =====

//This page answers the question:// //What are audio markers?//

A handy feature found in some audio recording software programs is the ability to place markers (or flags or cues) in the audio waveform. These markers are used to indicate special points or boundaries in the audio.

Markers can be used for any purpose that the recordist believes will be helpful. These are some common uses:

  * Identifying the start of a new section of audio, such as a frame in Open Bible Stories or a verse in Scripture.
  * Identifying a section of audio that needs to be fixed or reviewed.
  * Identifying a point of progress in the review process.


==== Types ====

Most software programs that permit markers will allow two different types of markers, which can be used for different purposes.

**Point Marker** - A Point Marker identifies a single point in the time line. These are more often used for identifying sections of audio, such as verses or OBS frames. Ocenaudio gives point markers a yellow flag at the top.

**Region Marker** - A Region Marker identifies a region of audio in the time line marked with start and end boundaries. This type is often used to identify a section of audio that needs further attention for editing or review. Ocenaudio gives region markers a red flag at the top and red vertical boundary lines.


==== Placement ====
Point markers can be placed in the audio track in the following ways:

  * Pressing the assigned keyboard shortcut key. The marker will be placed in the audio at the location of the play cue. The play cue can be placed in a location by clicking in the waveform. Point markers can also be placed while the audio file is recording or playing.
  * Clicking in the waveform to choose location for marker. Then click on the Edit Menu and select Create Marker.

Region markers are identified with a red flag and can be placed by clicking in the waveform and selecting a range of audio. Then press the keyboard shortcut key or choose Create Marker from the Edit Menu.


==== Moving Markers ====
The location of point markers can be adjusted by clicking on the yellow flag and dragging the marker to the desired location. The boundaries of region markers can be adjusted by clicking on the red flags and dragging to the desired location.


==== Deleting Markers ====
Caution must be used when choosing to delete point markers in Ocenaudio because the auto-numbering system will continue advancing to the next sequential number, even if a marker number is deleted. To preserve a numbering sequence it is recommended to move markers to the correct location rather than delete them. To delete a point marker, simply right click on the yellow flag and select "Delete Marker".

To delete a region marker, simply right click on the red flag and select “Delete Region”. In Ocenaudio, region markers do not share a relationship or have an impact on the auto-numbering of point markers.

==== Naming Markers ====
Many software programs auto-name point markers. For example, Ocenaudio automatically names markers as they are placed as Marker 1, Marker 2, Marker 3, etc. The name of the marker can be viewed by moving the cursor over the flag on the marker. We recommend using the auto-naming function to your advantage as a simple way to identify verses or OBS frames. This saves time spent manually naming the markers on a lot of content types that only need sections marked intuitively, not specific descriptions in the marker name. If necessary, you can rename a marker by hovering the cursor over the marker name and clicking on it.
