===== Noise Floor =====

**This page answers the question:** ////What is the noise floor?////

==  ==

Once the process of setting the mic gain has been completed, we need to make sure the noise floor is still below -45 dB before proceeding with the recording session. If you are using the right kind of equipment and have followed the steps above, you should find yourself with a sufficiently quiet noise floor, preferably -55 dB or less. If the noise floor is louder than -45 dB, you either have 

  * equipment ill-suited for voice recording or 
  * something in the setup process has not been done properly
  * you location is very poorly suited for recording. 

Rather than proceeding to record with a high noise floor, we highly recommend relocating, seeking support and/or training in setting the gain level properly.
