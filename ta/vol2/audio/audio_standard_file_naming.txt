===== File Naming Standard =====

This module answers the question: //What is the file naming standard for unfoldingWord audio?//\\
==  ==

Also known as a File Naming Convention, a file naming standard identifies a specific, reliable pattern to be followed for naming audio files. This helps maintain excellent organization of audio files during both the recording process and for subsequent distribution, as well as clarity in identification for years to come.


**General Guidelines**

  * use the official IETF language code found on door43.org
  * use an underscore (_) to separate information fields
  * use a hyphen (-) to identify
    * a subgroup or regional dialect of a language
    * frames within Open Bible Stories



**Open Bible Stories (file as full story)**

Template:        language code_content name_story number

Examples:
                en_obs_01
                en_obs_02
                pt-br_obs_28
                es-419_obs_50


**Open Bible Stories (file as story frame)**

Template:        language code_content name_story number-frame number

Examples:
                en_obs_01-01
                en_obs_01-02
                pt-br_obs_28-04
                es-419_obs_50-17


**Scripture**

Template:        language code_Bible type_book number_book name_chapter number

Examples:
                en_ulb_01_gen_01
                es-419_ulb_19_sal_119
                fr_udb_55_2ti_01
                pt-br_ulb_44_ato_03
                en_???_66_rev_22  (???= label accordingly if a different open-licensed text)


**Other**

When recording draft versions or other scenarios where additional identification is needed, please use the format shown below and simply add an underscore (_) and text that clearly communicates what the file is. For example, a draft version of the first story in English Open Bible Stories would be:

                en_obs_01_draft 


//Note to Recordists://

Proper identification of each audio file is very important. Please verify:

  * file naming according to the guidelines above
  * that each file name matches the recorded content
  * total file count for any missing or duplicated files
  * markers/cues are placed in the audio file for OBS frames or Scripture verses
