===== The Content =====

//This page answers the question:// //What is involved in preparing the content?//

Regarding the content that will be recorded, there are several areas of preparation needed.

==== Licensing ====

If you are recording open-license, CC BY-SA content, no further preparation is needed in the area of license. You are free to record.

If you are planning to record copyrighted content that is not licensed CC BY-SA, you will need to obtain permission from the copyright holder. unfoldingWord does not provide support or publishing for content with restrictive licensing, so this paragraph serves only to raise awareness that content with conventional copyright licensing cannot be legally recorded without permission from the owner. This is an issue that is sometimes misunderstood by recordists and may cause significant criminal penalties in many parts of the world for the recording team, publisher or anyone receiving distributed copies. The recording team and/or organization also damages their trustworthiness as a result of not honoring the license terms placed on intellectual property owned by others.


==== Updated text ====

Make sure you have the latest version of the text you plan to record.


==== Copies for the team ====

Be sure the members on your recording team all have an identical copy of the most up to date text, whether a print version or a digital version on a laptop or uW app.
