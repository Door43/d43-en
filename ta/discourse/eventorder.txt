====== Order of Events ======

Clarification on the sequence of events (or order of events) is critical in reading and translating.  Attentiveness to  "Ordinal words" such as, - first, second, third, and so on is one important key.

Paying close attention to time words such as, yesterday, last year, before, or next year will also help.

Then is another critical word implying something happened, THEN another thing took place.

Therefore is a word that signals order of event.  Something has come before, THEREFORE another thing is being discussed.
