====== Writing Styles - Background Information ======

Feel free to watch a video (to view on a computer or a portable device) on Background Information or read the information below.

Stories should be interesting to read. Every story has a storyline. The storyline tells a series of events in chronological order and has a beginning, middle and end. It is full of action verbs that moves the reader along the storyline. Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break usually contains background information. An author may use background information for several reasons:

  * To add interest to the story.
  * To provide important historical or cultural information.
  * To tell the reader, or listener, something very important

I have a story to tell you about John. It is a story with a beginning, middle, and end that is filled with action verbs.

//Peter and John went on a hunting trip. They walked for hours through low bushes before they found three small animals. They killed, cleaned and cooked the animals, then ate them for dinner. Peter and John made sure they arrived home while it was still light.//

Here is the same story with added background information in bold letters:

//Peter and John went on a hunting trip. **Peter was the best hunter in the village. He once killed 10 large birds in one day**! (**Peter is the son of Samuel, who is the son of Daniel, who was the greatest hunter of all times from his family.)**  They walked for hours **through **  low bushes before they found three small animals. They killed, cleaned, and cooked the animals  **in a large pot that they had brought along with them ** , then ate them for dinner. Peter and John made sure they arrived home while it was still light,  **because it was dangerous to travel in the dark.**//

===== Translation Guidelines =====

Sometimes background information adds interest to the story:

  * In this story the added information of where John and Peter were walking adds interest to the story. It is not necessary for the storyline but does provide word pictures of where John and Peter walked. Word pictures add interest to stories. Does your language have a certain way to add interesting descriptions to a story? Perhaps, in your language descriptions come after the subject. So the author would write “walking through bushes that are low to the ground”.
  * **Peter was the best hunter in the village. His record was 10 large birds in one day!**  The additional information about Peter being the best hunter in the village adds interest to the story by providing background information about Peter. How does your language present this type of added information to a story? Perhaps your language would describe Peter’s skill as a hunter before the start of the story. Perhaps your language uses special words that alert the reader of background information added that may interrupt the storyline.

Sometimes background information adds important cultural or historical information.

  * The author pauses the storyline to add historical information about Peter’s ancestry. **(Peter is the son of Samuel who is the son of Daniel who was the greatest hunter of all times from his family.)** Sometimes English punctuation uses parenthesis to signal information set apart from the story. Other times, English speakers will say “now” before telling background information. For example: “Now, Peter is the son of Samuel.” A clue that this is background information is the verb “is.” Does your language have punctuation signals to indicate background information? You will want to use the punctuation of your language, and not the source language, when you translate historical information found in a storyline.
  * Sometimes an author may pause the storyline to add something that happened at an earlier point of the story. In this story when the author pauses to tell the reader something that was not explicitly stated before, he put the information in parenthesis. The words “**that they had brought along with them**” tells about the pot. How does your language indicate when an author refers to something that happened at an earlier point in the story?

An author will use background to tell the reader, or listener, something very important. Sometimes the background information might be understood by the hearer but the author want to make sure that __everyone__ that hears the story understands.

  * The author wants to make sure that the reader understands the importance of John and Peter being home before dark. The author takes a break in the storyline and adds the reason for them to travel in the daytime. Perhaps your language would state this information as a separate sentence or arrange the information in the sentence differently.

Background information is important and should not be omitted for several reasons:

  * It adds interest to the story.
  * Provides important historical or cultural information.
  * Tells the reader, or listener, something very important.

To keep translations clear and natural you will need to study the grammar and punctuation of your language. Observe how your language presents background information in writings. Follow those same grammar rules when you translate.
