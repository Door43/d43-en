====== Double Negatives ======

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The usual negatives in the English language are "not" and the prefix "un." The typical pattern of a double negative sentence is a negative form of a verb (cannot, did not) used with a negative adverb (i.e. unhappy), negative pronoun (i.e. no one) or a negative conjunction (i.e. neither, nor).</font>

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Most of the time, a double negative statement is not the best way to express something. Double negatives can be vague.</font>

For example: To say, "It is not unlikely" may mean "It is likely." or "It could happen."

There may be times when a vague statement is desired or preferred. An example might be "She was not unattractive."

===== Examples from the Bible and Translation Suggestions =====

**Titus 3:14** //Our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that meet urgent needs so that they may not be unfruitful.//

**"So that they may not be unfruitful" ** is a double-negative.  It could be stated positively: “so they will be fruitful” or “so they can produce fruit for God” or “so their lives will be useful.”
===== <font 14px font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.4;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Please note, some double negations are simply incorrect. For someone to say “I didn't see nothing” is both wrong and likely to be contrary to what the speaker intended to say. Another example of incorrect grammar would be “I don't have no money.” The speaker likely intended to say “I have no money or I don't have any money.”</font>  =====

Making positive statements will protect from double negative errors. "I have none" uses a positive verb with a negative object. "I want nothing" is a similar form. Should you prefer to use the negative with the verb, these sentences could be stated as, "I do not have any" or "I don't want anything", since "any" and "anything" express positive quantities.
