====== Gender Notations ======

The English language makes a distinction in pronouns between male, female and neutral nouns.

"Whomever" is neither masculine nor feminine. The same is true for 'it'; however, it is not a word English ever uses for people.

===== Examples from English =====

English has two gender-specific //3rd Person Singular Pronouns// that depend on the sex of the individual referenced.
  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Masculine Pronoun: //**he **- refers to a male person
  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Feminine Pronoun: //**she **- refers to a female person 
 
English has one gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun//, however, it can only refer to non-human things.

  * //3rd Person Singular Non-human Pronoun//: **it**  - refers to a singular thing

===== Examples from the Bible =====

===== Translation Suggestions =====

The author followed the natural grammatical pattern of his own language, only making such distinctions when he wants to make a deliberate contrast. The translator should also follow the natural grammatical pattern of the Target Language.
