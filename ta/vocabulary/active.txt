====== Active or Passive ======

The English language has the active and passive form of speech.

  * In the **ACTIVE**  form, the subject does the action.
  * In the **PASSIVE**  form, the action is done to the subject.

==== Examples ====

**Active**  - Peter built the house. \\ **Passive**  - The house was built by Peter.

**Active**  - Worms ate the apple. \\ **Passive**  - The apple was eaten by worms.

==== Ask yourself:  Who or What is the subject in this sentence? ====

  * In the **ACTIVE**  form, the subject that does the action is always mentioned.
  * In the **PASSIVE**  form, the subject that does the action is //not always//  mentioned.

==== If you are confused about the subject, ask yourself:  What action took place...and who/what received the action. ====

Typically, confusion is more likely in passive sentences.

For example, consider this passive voice sentence:  The dinner was enjoyed by all.

Dinner is the subject.  The verb for this sentence is a phrase:  'was enjoyed.'  (Note:  Was is a state-of-being very and those are often found in passive sentences.)

To turn this into an active form, consider who enjoyed the meal.  Switching to:  'All enjoyed dinner.' gives you an active voice sentence with the same meaning.

In summary:  To change a **PASSIVE**  form to an **ACTIVE**  form it is necessary to state who, or what, did the action.

For example: \\ **Passive **- …. and when Jesus was baptized. \\ **Active **- … and when //John//  baptized Jesus.

==== Why/How the Passive is Used in English ====

  - To avoid focusing on the person who is doing the action. So that the reader is focused on the person, or thing, to which the action was done.
  - The person that did the action is not known. (My bike was stolen last night.)
  - The writer may not want to openly name the person that does the action. (The stones will be torn down.)
  - For effect, to emphasize an idea while minimizing other ideas.

==== Translating Hints ====

  * Many languages do not have a passive form, only the active form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the passive form into the active form.
  * To change a passive form to an active form it will be necessary to state openly who did the action.
  * Consider why the passive form was used in the verse. There should be ways of achieving the same effect in the translation.

==== Ideas on Changing the Passive Form ====

Does your language have a non-specific form of the pronoun? This might be translated as "they did something" or "one did something" where "they" or "one" does not refer to anyone in particular. If so, then this form can be used to translate the English passive, especially in the cases where the person doing the action is not stated openly.

Some languages have both the passive and active forms; however, the language does not use them in the same way.

**Consider carefully how to best use the forms in your language before using the passive form wherever the English language does.**
