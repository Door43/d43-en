People, places and some things are easy to understand because they can be experienced in the physical world.  Ideas and things like 'contentment' or 'peace' are equally real but not tangible objects.  Much of life, much of Scripture, involves experiencing realities that cannot be seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched in a physical sense.  ABSTRACT NOUNS are the tool that allows us to express such things.</font>

Some abstract nouns are related to things which can be interacted with physically.  For example, child is a concrete noun.  A child is a tangible, touchable being.  Childhood, though, is an intangible concept that relates to children.  Childhood is an abstract noun.  Another example is 'son.'  Son is a concrete noun that describes an individual.  Sonship is an abstract noun that refers to the essence of the relationship of being a son.

Other abstract nouns point directly to concepts, attitudes, emotions or characteristics.  Goodness, contentment, justice are examples of those types of abstract nouns.  ABSTRACT NOUNS are powerful tools that present unique challenges.  Anything abstract is subject to the influence of personal interpretation.  It is important to understand the cultural and historical context of abstractions so that the translation conveys the original meaning.  Definitions from the source language (e.g. Greek, Aramaic or Hebrew) are a valuable tool.  It is equally important to be aware of a reader's likely understanding of a concept.  Careful selection of abstract nouns...and the use of supportive, related concrete nouns is helpful for clarity and understanding.

There are common word endings (suffixes) that may help you quickly identify abstract nouns.  They include such endings as:

-tion; -ism; -ity; -ment; -ness; -age; -ance; -ence; -ship; -ability; -acy
