====== Adjectival Noun ======

To understand Adjectival Noun, you need a basic understanding of ADJECTIVES and NOUNS; the general [[http://door43.org/en/ta/vocabulary/parts-of-speech?s[]=noun|English Structure ]]page will provide that foundation more fully. In short, a noun is a person, place or thing. An adjective describes a noun. An ADJECTIVAL NOUN simply combines a noun with another noun that functions as an adjective.

===== Examples from English =====

An example is the quickest way to clarify. A Bible teacher is an adjectival noun. Both Bible and teacher are nouns; however in this context Bible is used to explain 'what kind of' teacher (e.g. a Bible teacher). Some other examples include: chariot race; church building; school bus.

Note: an adjective may also be combined with an adjectival noun. For example: yellow school bus or wild chariot race. Both of those examples add an adjective into the mix to further describe the noun.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Gentile descendants - Gentile is a noun; it describes non-Jewish people.  In this context, Gentile descendants, we see an adjectival noun.

Macedonian believers, Midianite hordes, Israeli camp

===== Translation Suggestions =====

In the first example above, it could be translated 'the descendants of Gentile people.'  Likewise, believers of Macedonia would be equal to the second example given.  When the adjectival noun portrays 'ownership or belonging', use the noun and change the adjectival noun into an "of ...." phrase.  Using a possessive form of a noun is another possibility (e.g. Israel's camp).
