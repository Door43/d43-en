====== Singular Pronouns ======


**Singular pronouns replace singular nouns, which are those that name one person, place, thing, or idea.** 


//**Singular Personal Pronouns** //**//:// ** 


Personal pronouns refer to people.


    * //1st Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **I/me**  - refers to the //Speaker//
    * //2nd Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **you**  - refers to the //Addressee// 
In Standard English, **you**  is also used to refer to many different //Addressees//. Therefore, the //Singularity // vs. //Plurality // of **you**  is based on context.


Many language have one gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun//, however, English has two, depending on the sex of the individual referenced.


    * //3rd Person Singular Personal Masculine Pronoun: //**he **- refers to a male person
    * //3rd Person Singular Personal Feminine Pronoun: //**she **- refers to a female person
English has a gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun//, however, it can only refer to inanimate (non-living) objects.


    * //3rd Person Singular Inanimate Pronoun//: **it**  - refers to a singular thing
Therefore, if you want to remain gender-neutral in referencing a single person, you must use the phrase "he or she".


Often times, however, "they" is used in place of a singular gender-neutral pronoun as opposed to the phrase "he or she".


"If __a student__  wants to get a good grade on the test, then __he or she__  must study hard."


"If __a student__  wants to get a good grade on the test, then __they__  must study hard."


**//Singular Demonstrative Pronouns// ** 


    * **this**
    * **that** 
**//Singular Indefinite Pronouns// ** 


**//Singular Relative Pronouns// ** 


//Relative// Pronouns//// are used at the beginning of clauses.


    * **who/whom**  - refers only to a person or people
    * **that**
    * **which** 
Both **who/whom**  and **that**  are often used interchangeably, however, as **who/whom**  can only refer to people, use of **who/whom**  over **that**  in reference to people can imply humanization.


"our messiah __that__  came to save us" (Jesus the son of God)


"our messiah __who__  came to save us" (Jesus the son of man)
