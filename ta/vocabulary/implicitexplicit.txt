Explicit and Implicit Information

====== \\
This lesson presents two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages.  One is called explicit and the other implicit.\\
Every message is about a situation. The speaker, or writer, has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.\\
A message with all information included is explicit,\\
A message that leaves out information but is still understood is implicit.\\
Although implicit information is not stated in words and only implied, it is information that the hearer needs to know if he is to understand the meaning of the message. ======

The speaker, or writer, has succeeded in communicating his message if the hearer correctly understands what was clearly stated as well as what was implied.\\
For example, David asks Susan:  “Where is Joe?”  Susan answers, “At work.” \\
David’s question is explicit because it is clearly stated and easily understood by Susan.\\
Susan’s response is implicit but David understands her message is in fact “Joe is at work.”\\
Reading John 8 verses 10 and 11, ‘Jesus …asked her, “Woman where are they? Has no one condemned you?”  “No one, sir,” she said.’\\
Jesus’ question is explicit because it is clearly stated and understood. \\
If the woman’s reply were explicit, she would have said, “No one has condemned me, sir.” Even though the words “…has condemned me…” are left out, Jesus is still able to understand the woman. Her answer is understood because of the context of the conversation.\\
Since it is easier to understand a statement that is clearly expressed, why would a speaker or writer leave out information?

It may include information that the author assumes that his audience already knows, and therefore he feels he does not need to state it explicitly.\\
For example:\\
Information may be clear from the context.\\
Michael asks Jennifer: “How many books have you read?”  Jennifer answers “Three.”  Her reply of one word is clear from the context of the question asked. \\
She is actually saying that she has read three books\\
Another reason a speaker may omit certain information in a conversation is because it is part of the culture he shares with his listeners. \\
For example, a young boy living in a community of cattle ranchers says, “I didn’t go to school today because it is going to rain tonight.” His listeners understand why he is not going to school. They know that the hay in the fields needs to be covered before the rains come so that it will not mold in the field.\\
Your language may allow certain information to be omitted. Perhaps your language has a different pronoun for the singular or plural “you.” Some languages make a difference between different genders in the third person pronoun: “he”, “she”, and “it”; while others make no distinction.\\
Mark is addressing two people: Mark says to Jo and Ed:  “Where are you going?” Jo responds with, “To the church meeting.”\\
Jo does not need to say “we” are going because it is understood.\\
The situation the speaker finds himself in may enable a quick message of one word. For example: a father seeing his son about to strike his little sister shouts “No!” \\
At another time, he may say “No” for quite another reason, but here the child clearly understands the implicit message to be “No, do not strike your sister.”\\
Finally, the speaker may believe something else should be the focus. John writes in chapter 13 verse 23: “One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.”\\
Bible scholars agree that John was referring to himself in this verse but he chose not to reveal that fact. Possibly because he did not want to be the focus of the message so he omitted the explicit information.

Translators need to be particularly sensitive when information is not explicit.\\
If something is obscure in the text, keep it obscure in the translation.

The translation should always have the same meaning as the source text.

So, what if there is implied information that would lead the reader to either an unclear or incorrect understanding of the original message?  Is it okay to make it more explicit?\\
The translator always wants to make sure the reader understands the original meaning of the message. This may mean the translation may have additional information included to make the meaning clear. \\
Implied information may be made explicit if: \\
Only the implied information in the original message is made explicit,\\
No new information is added\\
It is necessary in order to communicate the main point of the message,\\
No meaning, or a wrong meaning would be communicated without the added information\\
It does not change the meaning so it is no longer true or accurate\\
or it is suitable to the original situation in which the message was given.\\
Let us review the reasons there may be implied information in a message:\\
the speaker or author may leave out certain information if it is clear from the context; [pause]  if it is part of a shared cultural background; [pause]  if the grammar allows it to be unstated; [pause] if the situation makes it appropriate; [pause]  or if the author wants to keep something else in focus.\\
Now let’s review the guidelines for changing implicit information to explicit: If the translator decides additional information needs to be added to make the meaning clear, it may be added under certain conditions, if:  only the implied information is made explicit; [pause] no new information is added; [pause] it is necessary in order to communicate the main point of the message; [pause] no meaning or a wrong meaning would be communicated without the added information;[pause] it does not change the meaning so it is no longer true or accurate;[pause] it is suitable to the original situation in which the message was given.\\
Finally, you need to ask yourself if your translation is communicating accurately what the original message was saying.\\
This concludes the lesson on Explicit and Implicit information.
