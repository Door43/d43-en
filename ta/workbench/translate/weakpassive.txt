Verb forms can be part of the main verb: "He had __fattened__ the sheep for the feast." They can also describe nouns: "Eat the flesh of the __fattened__ sheep." When they describe nouns, verb forms give an idea of how the noun came to be as it is. These verb forms look like passive verbs, so we call them weak passives.
 
===== Description =====

Weak passives are verb forms that describe nouns by giving an idea of how the noun came to be as it is.

**the things __made of bronze and iron__ are holy** (Joshua 6:19 ULB)\\
The writer is concerned with what materials have gone into "the things," not who actually made them.

**Reason this is a translation issue:** The translator may use so many words to identify the actor in a weak passive that the reader misses the main point of the sentence.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**with his hands full of finely __ground__ sweet incense** (Leviticus 16:12 ULB)\\
The phrase "finely ground sweet incense" says that someone is to grind the sweet incense into very small pieces. Who is to do the grinding is not important.

**the __accused__ man should have an opportunity** (Acts 25:16 ULB)\\
The phrase "the accused man" says that someone has accused the man, but who had done the accusing is not important.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If a weak passive would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using one. If not, here are other options: 

  - Find a word that describes the noun after the action.
  - Use a subordinate clause to describe the noun.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
 
1. Find a word that describes the noun after the action.
  * **the things __made of bronze and iron__ are holy** (Joshua 6:19 ULB)
    * "the __bronze and iron__ things are holy"
  * **with his hands full of finely __ground__ sweet incense** (Leviticus 16:12 ULB)
    * "with his hands full of __powder__ of sweet incense"

2. Use a subordinate clause to describe the noun.
  * **Eat the flesh of the __fattened__ sheep** (Zechariah 11:16 ULB)
    * "Eat the flesh of the sheep __that have become fat__"
    * "Eat the flesh of the sheep __that they have made fat__"
  * **the __accused__ man should have an opportunity** (Acts 25:16 ULB)
    * "the man __whom they have accused__ should have an opportunity"
