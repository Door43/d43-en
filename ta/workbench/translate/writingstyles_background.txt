====== Writing Styles - Background Information ======

Feel free to watch a video (to view on a [[http://youtu.be/ywevLJl1PNI|computer]] or a [[http://youtu.be/7ZD-I9iqvaw|portable device]]) on Background Information or read the information below.

Every story has a storyline. The storyline tells a series of events in chronological order and has a beginning, middle and end. It is full of action verbs that moves the reader along the storyline. Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break usually contains background information. An author may use background information for several reasons:

  * To add interest to the story.
  * To provide important historical or cultural information.
  * To tell the reader, or listener, something very important

===== Translation Suggestions =====

To keep translations clear and natural you will need to study the grammar and punctuation of your language. Observe how your language presents background information in writings. Follow those same grammar rules when you translate.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

===== Examples from English =====

I have a story to tell you about John. It is a story with a beginning, middle, and end that is filled with action verbs.

//Peter and John went on a hunting trip. They walked for hours through low bushes before they found three small animals. They killed, cleaned and cooked the animals, then ate them for dinner. Peter and John made sure they arrived home while it was still light.//

Here is the same story with added background information in bold letters:

//Peter and John went on a hunting trip. **Peter was the best hunter in the village. He once killed 10 large birds in one day**! (**Peter is the son of Samuel, who is the son of Daniel, who was the greatest hunter of all times from his family.)** They walked for hours through low bushes before they found three small animals. They killed, cleaned, and cooked the animals **in a large pot that they had brought along with them ** , then ate them for dinner. Peter and John made sure they arrived home while it was still light, **because it was dangerous to travel in the dark.** //
