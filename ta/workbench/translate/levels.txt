====== Levels of Meaning ======
A good translation requires that the meaning is the same in the target language as in the source language.

There are many different levels of meaning in the Bible. These levels include: 
  * Meaning of words
  * Meaning of phrases
  * Meaning of sentences
  * Meaning of paragraphs
  * Meaning of chapters
  * Meaning of books

==== Words Have Meaning ====

That is, even the smallest unit, a word, has a meaning. For example, the single word like "walk" may have the following possible meanings, depending on the language:
  * to go somewhere by foot
  * to go and come back by foot
  * to go repeatedly by foot
  * to stroll slowly
  * to walk briskly
  * to go alone
  * to go as a group
  * for a male to go by foot
  * for a female to go by foot

==== Building the Larger Meaning ====
The translator must determine what each word means in the text, and then reproduce the same meaning in the translated text. These words then combine into phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. Therefore, the translator must also make sure that the words fit together into equivalent phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. so that the translated text has the same meaning on each level.
