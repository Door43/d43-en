====== Order of Events ======

//This module answers the question:  When the events not listed in the order they happened, how do I translate them?//

//In order to understand this page, it would be good to read//

In the Bible, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred. Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just wrote about. This can be confusing to the reader.

==== Description ====

In the Bible, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred. Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just talked about. This can be confusing to the reader.

**Reason this is a translation issue:** Readers might think that the events happened in the order that they are told. It is important to help them understand the correct order of events.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

> But then Herod ... had John locked up in prison. Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized. (Luke 3:20-21 ULB)\\ 
This could sound like John baptized Jesus after John was locked up in prison.

> Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets… But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout."   (Joshua 6:8-10 ULB)\\ 
This sounds like Joshua gave the order not to shout after the army had already started their march.

>Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals? (Revelation 5:2 ULB)\\ 
The seals that lock the scroll must be broken before the scroll can be unrolled.

==== Translation Strategies ====

  - If your language uses phrases or time words to show that an event happened before one that was already mentioned, consider using one of them.
  - If your language uses verb tense or aspect to show that an event happened before one that was already mentioned, consider using that. (See: the section on Aspect on [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]])
  - If your language prefers to tell events in the order that they occurred, consider reordering the events so they they are in that order. This may require putting two or more verses together (like 5-6). (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. If your language uses phrases, time words or tenses to show that an event happened before the one just mentioned, consider using one of them.
  * **<sup>20</sup> But then Herod ... had John locked up in prison. <sup>21</sup> Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized.** (Luke 3:20-21) 
    * <sup>20</sup> "But then Herod ... had John locked up in prison. <sup>21</sup> __Before John was put in prison,__ while all the people were being baptized by John, Jesus also was baptized."
 
  * **Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?** (Revelation 5:2) \\ 
    * "Who is worthy to open the scroll __after__ breaking its seals?"

2. If your language uses verb tense or aspect to show that an event happened before one that was already mentioned, consider using that.

  * **<sup>8</sup> Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets...<sup>10</sup> But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout."**   (Joshua 6:8-10)
    * "<sup>8</sup> Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets...<sup>10</sup> But Joshua __had commanded__ the people, saying, "Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout." "

3. If your language prefers to tell events in the order that they occur, consider reordering the events. This may require putting two or more verses together (like 5-6). \\

  * **<sup>8</sup> Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets...<sup>10</sup> But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "Do not shout.

    * "<sup>8-10</sup> Joshua commanded the people, saying, "Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout." Then just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets…"
