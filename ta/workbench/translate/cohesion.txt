====== zzz Do not use - Cohesion ======

Cohesion is the word relationships that link different parts of a text. Cohesion organizes a text.

Material that is written cohesively helps the reader understand the text. Cohesion helps a reader understand how sentences relate to one another and how they relate to the topic.

Cohesion can be created two ways: one is by the structure of the text; the other is by the meaning.

Each language has its own patterns to show the different relationships and create cohesion. Specific words and phrases that join sentences together are common tools for increasing cohesion. The use of sequencing or time order is another method to build cohesion. Cause and effect, compare and contrast, and conclusion are other typical techniques for building cohesion. The occurrence of the same word multiple times in a text, the use of a similar word or the substitution of one word for another (e.g. a pronoun for a noun) all increase cohesion.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Keeping the same word consistent is a good way to build cohesion (example: always use 'dog' instead of hound, canine, pooch, etc.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Psa 25:2-3

<sup> 2  </sup> O my God, I trust in Thee. Let me not be ashamed; let not mine enemies triumph over me.

<sup> 3  </sup> Yea, let none that wait on Thee be ashamed; let them be ashamed that transgress without cause.

Psa 125:1-2

They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.

<sup> 2  </sup> As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about His people from henceforth, even for ever.

===== Examples from English =====

In English, the simple joining of sentences is typically done with a conjunction.

//**CONJUNCTIONS:**// and, but, or, for, nor, yet, so, if only, then, since, whenever, while, unless, because

//**TRANSITION WORDS**//: specifically, chiefly, in the beginning, following, in conclusion, to summarize, as a result, moreover

We went to his work first, and then we returned to our house.

We went to the store, but John forgot his wallet.
