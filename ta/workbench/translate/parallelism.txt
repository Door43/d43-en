====== Parallelism ======

**Parallelism ** is a poetic device in which one idea is expressed in two or more different ways. Parallelism is a prominent feature of Biblical Hebrew poetry most commonly found in the books of Psalms and Proverbs, but also throughout the whole of the Bible.

Note: We are using the term __parallelism__ for long phrases or clauses that are similar in grammatical structure or idea and are used together. We are using the term __doublets__ for words or short phrases that mean basically the same thing and are used together.

Parallelism in poetry has several effects:

  * It shows that something is very important by saying it more than once and in more than one way.
  * It makes the language more beautiful and above the ordinary way of speaking.
  * It makes the poem more memorable and easier to sing.
  * It helps the hearer to think more deeply about the idea by saying it in different ways.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Translate both clauses. This is good to do in poetic and prophetic texts.
  * __If__ the two clauses mean the same thing, and __if__ people misunderstand and think that they are about two different things, then you may need to write just one clause.
    * You can do that by combining the ideas of both clauses into one.
    * If it appears that the clauses are used together to show that what they say is really true, you could include words that emphasize the truth such as "truly" or "certainly."
    * If it appears that the clauses are used together to intensify an idea in them, you could use words like "very," "completely" or "all."
===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.** Psalm 119:105\\
If this were written as two sentences it would be: Your word is a lamp to my feet. Your word is a light for my path. You can see that both sentences are metaphors about God's word. The words 'lamp' and 'light' are parallel to each other because they refer to light. The words 'my feet' and 'my path' are also parallel, because they refer to where a person walks. So both sentences are talking about how God's word shows the person the way to walk. The sentences mean the same thing, but they say it with different words.

**Praise Yahweh, all you nations; exalt him, all you peoples!** Psalm 117:1

Both parts of this verse are telling people everywhere to praise Yahweh. You can see the parallel words that have similar meaning: 'Praise' and 'exalt,' 'Yahweh' and 'him,' 'all you nations' and 'all you peoples.' The verse is not talking to two different groups; they are the same group. The verse is saying the same thing twice in different words.

**For Yahweh has a lawsuit with his people, and he will contend with Israel.** Micah 6:2

In some verses of poetry the parallel words might be more difficult to identify, such as in Micah 6:2. But even here we can see that 'Yahweh' and 'he' are parallel, and also 'his people' and 'Israel,' as well as 'has a lawsuit' and 'will contend.' The two parts of the verse are both saying that Yahweh has a serious disagreement with his people, Israel. These are not two different disagreements or two different groups of people. If people misunderstand verses with parallelism and think that they are making two different statements, then you could translate them as one statement. For example, you could translate Micah 6:2 as, "For Yahweh has a lawsuit with his people, Israel."
