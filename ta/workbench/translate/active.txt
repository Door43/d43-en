===== Description =====


Some languages have both the active and passive forms of speech.
  * In the **ACTIVE** form, the subject does the action and is always mentioned.
  * In the **PASSIVE**  form, the action is done to the subject and the one who does the action is //not always//  mentioned.

In the examples of active and passive sentences below, we have underlined the subject \\
**ACTIVE**: __My father__  built the house in 2010. \\ 
**PASSIVE**: __The house__  was built by my father in 2010. \\ 
**PASSIVE**: __The house__  was built in 2010. (This does not tell who did the action.)

All languages have active forms. Some languages have passive forms, and some do not. 
The passive form is not used for the same reasons in all of the languages that have it.

=== Purposes for the passive: ===
  * The speaker is talking about the person or thing the action was done to, not about the person who did the action.
  * The speaker does not want to tell who did the action. 
  * The speaker does not know who did the action.
=== Translation Principles Regarding the Passive ===
  * Translators whose language does not use passive forms will need to find another way to express the idea. 
  * Translators whose language has passive forms will need to understand why the passive is used in a particular sentence in the Bible and decide whether or not to use a passive form for that purpose in his translation of the sentence.


===== Examples from the Bible =====


===== Translation Strategies =====
If you decide that it is best to translate without a passive form, then there are three possibilities.
  - Use the same verb in an active sentence and tell who or what did the action.
  - Use the same verb in an active sentence, and do not tell who or what did the action.
  - Use a different verb.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Use the same verb in an active sentence and tell who did the action.
  * Passive: **A loaf of bread __was given__ him every day from the street of the bakers.** (Jeremiah 37:21)
    * __The king's servants gave__  Jeremiah a loaf of bread every day from the street of the bakers.
2. Use the same verb in an active sentence, and do not tell who did the action. Instead use a generic expression like "they," or "people," or “someone.” \\
  * Passive: **It would be better for him if a millstone __were put__  around his neck and he __were thrown__  into the sea.**   (Luke 17:1-2)
    * It would be better for him if __they were to put__  a millstone around his neck and __throw__  him into the sea.
    * It would be better for him if __someone were to put__  a heavy stone around his neck and __throw__  him into the sea.
3. Use a different verb. \\
  * Passive: **A loaf of bread __was given__  him every day from the street of the bakers.** (Jeremiah 37:21)
    * He __received__  a loaf of bread every day from the street of the bakers.
  *Passive:  **Already the ax __has been placed__  against the root of the trees.**    (Luke 3:9)
    * Already the ax is against the root of the trees.
