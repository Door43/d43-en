====== translationNotes Connecting Statement and General Statement ======
question: Why do some translationNotes not have any ULB text at the beginning?

Depend: inclusive we ; pronouns

==== Description =====

Sometimes there is a translationNote, at the top of the list of notes, that may not include any ULB text. They may be separated from the other notes by a blank line. These notes are 'Connecting Statements' or 'General Statements.'

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is a note that relates the current chunk to the entire passage from the Bible. There is only one connecting statement per chunk.

  * **General Statement:** - This is a note that addresses other writing style topics not mentioned in the connecting statement. There can be one or more General Statements in a chunk.

=== Purpose ===

The Connecting Statement and General Statement provide the following information:
  * Describe the use of pronouns in the chunk. There will be a 'General Statement' if every time the pronoun 'you' in the passage is a plural you or singular you, or if the pronouns are inclusive or exclusive.
  * Important background or implied information that is not in the chunk. 
  * Logical arguments and conclusions
  * Episode Identification (start, end, and continuation across chapters) 




=== Format ===

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Explanation
  * **General Statement:** - Explanation

  * Follow Standard Punctuation. Phrases do not use periods. Sentences do.
  * Follow Standard formatting for ta-topic links. Ex. (See: Metaphor_link)
  * Where reasonable express connecting sentence in present tense.

=== Bible Example ===

Luke1:1
  * **Connecting Statement:** - Luke explains why he is writing to Theophilus.

  * **accounts**  - "reports" or "true stories"
  * **[phrase]** - [explanation]
  * **[phrase]** - [explanation]

Episode/Speech Continuation (Acts 1:17)
    * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]]. 
  
Background Information (Acts 1:17)  
  * **General Statement:** - Verses 18-19 give background information about what Judas had done and how he died. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

Passage Recollection (Acts 2:25)
  * **General Statement:** - Here Peter recalls a passage spoken by David that relates to Jesus having been crucified and risen from the grave.



==== Translation Notes Examples ====

> But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart that you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath (Romans 2:5 ULB)

  * **But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart** - Paul compares a person who refuses to listen and obey God to something hard, like a stone. The heart represents the whole person. AT: "It is because you refuse to listen and repent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **hardness and unrepentant heart** - The phrase "unrepentant heart" explains the word "hardness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
In this example the translation suggestion first explains about the Figures of Speech and then explains about the Doublet in the same passage.
