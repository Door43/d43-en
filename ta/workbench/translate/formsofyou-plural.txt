The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. These languages both have a singular form of “you” and a plural form of “you.” Therefore we know whether each “you” in the Bible should be singular or plural. But even when reading the Bible in a language that does not have distinct singular and plural forms of “you,” the context will often make it clear whether the word “you” is intended to refer to one person, to two people, or to more than two people.

Some languages, such as English, have only one word for “you,” regardless of how many people are being spoken to. English speakers can refer to one person as “you” or to many people as “you.” Often the context will make it clear whether the word “you” refers to one person or more than one. Looking at the other pronouns in the sentence will help distinguish the number of people who are being spoken to.

Here is an example of the use of a dual pronoun “you”:

**And __James and John__, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And [Jesus] said to them, “What do __you__ want me to do for __you__?”** (Mark 10:35-36)

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And [Jesus] said to them, “What do __you__ want me to do for __you__?”** (Mark 10:35-36)

Jesus is asking the **two**, James and John, what they want him to do for them. If the target language has a dual form of “you,” it would be appropriate to use it here. If the target language does not have a dual form, then the plural form would be appropriate.

**Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of __you__, and just as __you__ enter it, __you__ will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.** (Mark 11:1-2)

The context makes it clear that Jesus is addressing two persons, so the dual form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. Here the verbs “go” and “untie” would also need the dual form.

In instructional texts, the “you” is often **plural** since it is addressing a wide audience. Here is an example:

**Since __you__ call on a Father who judges each man’s work impartially, live __your__ lives as strangers here in reverent fear.** (1 Peter 1:17)

===== Translation Strategies =====

If your language uses dual pronouns for "you," be on the lookout for appropriate places to use them. If you are not sure if you need to use dual or plural, then stick to plural.

Note that for many languages, the decision about what form of the pronoun to use will also affect the form of the verb associated with it, even in cases where the word “you” is not expressed (for example, in commands).

==== Forms of "You" in the Bible ====

The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. These languages both have a singular form of you and a plural form of you. Therefore we know when each "you" in the Bible should be [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_yousingular|'singular']] or plural. But even when reading the Bible in a language that does not have distinct singular and plural forms of "you," the context will often make it clear whether the word “you” is intended to refer to one person, to two people, or to more than two people. If the target language has a dual form of "you" that is used for speaking to only two people, the translator will need to decide from the context when it is appropriate to use this form.

Some languages, like English, have only one word for ‘you’ regardless of how many people are being spoken to. English speakers can refer to one person as ‘you’ or to many people as ‘you.’ Often the context will make it clear as to whether the word ‘you’ refers to one person or more than one.  Looking at the other pronouns in the sentence will help you distinguish the number of people who are being spoken to. 

Some languages have more than one word for ‘you’ depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the ‘singular’ form of ‘you’. If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual|‘plural’]] form of ‘you.’  Some languages have a [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual|‘dual’]] form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

Note that for many languages, the decision about what form of the pronoun to use will also affect the form of the verb associated with it, even in cases where the word “you” is not expressed (for example when a command is given).

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>//And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And [Jesus] said to them, “What do __you__ want me to do for __you__?”// -Mark 10:35-36

Jesus is asking the **two**, James and John, what they want him to do for them. If the target language has a dual form of "you," it would be appropriate to use it here. If the target language does not have a dual form, then the plural form would be appropriate.

>//…Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of __you__, and just as __you__ enter it, __you__ will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.// -Mark 11:1-2

The context makes it clear that Jesus is addressing two persons, so the dual form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. Here the verbs “go” and “untie” would also need the dual form.

In instructional text, the “you” is often **plural**  since it is addressing a wide audience. Here is an example:

>//Since __you__ call on a Father who judges each man’s work impartially, live __your__ lives as strangers here in reverent fear.// -1 Peter 1:17
