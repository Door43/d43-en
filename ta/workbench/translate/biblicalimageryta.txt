===== Biblical Imagery - tA =====

==== Metaphors and Similies ====

As in languages everywhere, most **metaphors** in Biblical Hebrew and Greek fall into broad patterns that are often unique to these languages. It is very useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.

See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part1]] for more information on how to translate metaphor and simile images into your own language.



==== Common Metonymies ====
(See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part2]])


==== Cultural Models ====
The Scriptures also employ cultural models, which can be described as systems of thought that are more elaborate and more developed than the metaphorical patterns and metonymies. Some of these models, at least, were employed extensively in the Ancient Near East, and not only among the Israelites.
