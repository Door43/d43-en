Hyperbole is a figure of speech in which the speaker shows that something is very important  by describing it as larger or greater than it really is. He may greatly exaggerate something in order to show his strong feeling or opinion about it, or he may generalize the situation by using words like "every" or "all" to mean "many." 

===== Description =====

Hyperbole is a figure of speech in which the speaker shows the importance of something by describing it as larger or greater than it really is. There are two kinds of hyperbole:

  - Exaggeration: This is when a speaker deliberately describes something by an extreme or even unreal statement, usually to show his strong feeling or opinion about it.\\
  - Generalization: This is when a speaker uses words like "every" or "all" to mean something like "very many," but not "__every__  one" (although "every" or "all" can also literally mean "**every** one" in other contexts). Some people may not call generalization like this "hyperbole."

**Reason this is a translation issue** - If readers do not understand that a statement is a hyperbole, they may either think that something happened that did not happen, or they may think that the speaker or writer was saying something that is not true. 

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Examples of **Exaggeration**:

**If your hand causes you to stumble, __cut it off__. It is better for you to enter into life maimed...** Mark 9:43a\\
When Jesus said to __cut off__ your hand, he meant that we should __do whatever extreme things we need to do in order not to sin__. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to try to stop sinning. Sin weakens our lives from following Jesus, so we must seriously seek to turn from sinning.\\
\\
**If anyone comes to me and does not __hate__ his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters--yes, and his own life also--he cannot be my disciple.** Luke 14:26
Because of many other things that Jesus said, we know that his use of the word “hate” here is hyperbole. He meant that __we must not love even our own family members more than we love him__. Because the Lord Jesus is our God and Savior, we must put him first. Our love for Jesus is the most important love in our lives.\\
\\
Examples of **Generalization**:\\
\\
**When the sun was setting, people brought to Jesus __everyone who was sick__ with various kinds of diseases. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. **  Luke 4:40 \\ Luke wrote that "everyone" brought their sick ones to Jesus. This is hyperbole. Probably not everyone did this, but __many__ did. Hyperbole helps to show how excited people were that Jesus could heal them and that __a large number__ of them came to him to be healed.\\ 
\\ 
**When they had brought their boats to land, __they left everything__ and followed him.**  Luke 5:11 \\ Luke wrote that when Jesus invited some fishermen to follow him, they left __everything__. We know that they left their fishing business. Saying that they left "everything" may be a case of hyperbole to emphasize that now they had completely given everything in their lives over to the control of the Lord Jesus.\\

===== Translation Strategies =====

  - Do not assume that something must be hyperbole just because it seems to be impossible. God does miraculous things. 
  - Keep the statement of hyperbole if it would not be misunderstood or thought to be a lie.
  - Express the meaning without the hyperbole. For example "all the people" could be translated as "large crowds of people."


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Do not assume that something must be hyperbole just because it seems to be impossible. God does miraculous things.
  * **... they saw Jesus __walking on the sea__ and coming near the boat ...** John 6:19
      Jesus walking on the sea is not hyperbole. He actually walked on the water, so this is not an exaggeration. It is a literal statement.\\

  * **... for __all__ have sinned and come short of the glory of God.**  Romans 3:23
      The word "all" here is not hyperbole. ALL humans have sinned (with only one exception, the God-man, Jesus Christ.)

2. Keep the statement of hyperbole if it would not be misunderstood or thought to be a lie.
  * **The Philistines gathered together to fight against Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand men to drive the chariots, and troops __as numerous as the sand on the seashore__.**\\ 1 Samuel 13:5
      The army of the Philistines is described as having as many soldiers as "the sand on the seashore." That statement is hyperbole and cannot be understood literally since the sand (grains of sand) on the seashore are so numerous they cannot be counted. Instead, the meaning is that there are many, many soldiers in the Philistine army. If in your language this hyperbole would be understood to mean many, many soldiers, and not literally to mean that the soldiers in the Philistine army are so many that no one can count them, then translate the statement of hyperbole. If the statement of hyperbole would not be understood, see number 3 below. 

3. Express the meaning without the hyperbole. For example "all the people" could be translated as "large crowds of people."\\
Also consider: 
  * **If anyone comes to me and does not __hate__ his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters–yes, and his own life also–he cannot be my disciple.** Luke 14:26\\
    Translate this with something like: "If anyone comes to me and does not __love me more than__ his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters–yes, and his own life also–he cannot be my disciple." Luke 14:26
