====== Hypothetical Situations ======

If the sun stops shining… What if the sun stops shining… Suppose the sun stops shining… If only the sun had not stopped shining. You use such expressions to set up hypothetical situations, imagining what might have happened or what might happen. Or expressing regret over what did happen. These occur often in the Bible and need to be translated carefully.

**Description**

A hypothetical situation is one that is assumed or supposed. It’s an idea or an action that depends on a condition to fulfill it. A hypothetical situation is a possible scenario at any point in time: past, present, or future. A hypothetical situation in the past did not really happen, but it could have happened under different circumstances. A hypothetical situation in the present or future may or may not actually happen—the speaker presents it as hypothetical because he does not know if it will happen or not, or it depends on the actions of others. It could possibly happen or it may never happen. A hypothetical situation might require asking a “what if” question. It might be expressed as a “suppose” or “if” or “if only” statement. Hypothetical situations are good teaching tools. Jesus often used them.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

  - Consider a hypothetical situation that **would never happen**:

**Then Jesus … said, "How difficult it is for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."**

Here in Luke 18:25 Jesus was teaching his disciples about how being rich can make it hard to enter God’s kingdom. To emphasize this, he said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to submit to God’s rule in their life. The hypothetical element is that a large camel could never squeeze through the eye of a very small sewing needle! Jesus used this hypothetical scenario to draw attention to his teaching point concerning the rich.

  - Consider a “suppose” scenario that **could possibly happen**.

**Jesus said to them, "What man would there be among you, who, __if __ he had just one sheep, and if this sheep fell into a deep hole on the Sabbath, would not grasp hold of it and lift it out?**

In Matthew 12:11 Jesus was pointing out to the religious leaders that they were not being honest when they judged people for working on the Sabbath day. Jesus wasn’t talking about a specific person who did this. Rather, he was talking about a possible situation that could and often did happen. He used the hypothetical story to help listeners understand his own actions.

  - The following is an example of a hypothetical scenario **in the past**:

**"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! __If__  the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.**

Here in Matthew 11:21 Jesus said that if the people living in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon had been able to see the miracles that he, Jesus, performed, they would have repented long ago. This is a hypothetical situation that we know did not happen. Jesus was pointing out the sin of the people of town of Capernaum, comparing them to Tyre and Sidon through a hypothesis: What if these people had seen the miracles? They would have repented. But Capernaum will not repent.

4. Often a hypothetical situation in the past **expresses an emotion, such as regret**. For example, consider Exodus 16:3:

**The Israelites said to them, "__If only__  we had died by Yahweh's hand in the land of Egypt when we were sitting by the pots of meat and were eating bread to the full. For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill our whole community with hunger."**

Here the Israelites are afraid they will have to suffer and die of hunger in the wilderness, and so they wish they had stayed in Egypt and died there with full stomachs.

===== Translation Strategies =====

It is important in translation to be able to recognize a hypothetical situation in the text and use appropriate words or phrases. You may need to show the timing of the hypothetical situation (past, present, or future). You may need to clarify that the scenario is only a possibility: that it might be true or not likely to be true or that it could possibly happen or would never happen. Hypothetical situations may or may not imply emotions or reasons. Some hypothetical statements may use expressions such as “what if,” “suppose,” or “if only” to help the reader understand the type of hypothetical situation. Perhaps your language uses special wording or specific language structures to communicate each of these things.

  * How would your language express a situation that could never happen?
  * How would you communicate a “suppose” scenario that could happen right now?
  * How would your language express a situation that may or may not happen in the future?
  * Does your language have a special way of indicating a hypothetical situation in the past?

How does your language express an “if only” or “I wish” scenario that also implies some emotion?

==== Definition ====

Something that is hypothetical is 'assumed' or 'supposed.' A hypothetical situation is a possible scenario from any point in time: past, present or future. A hypothetical situation in the past did not happen, but could have happened under different circumstances. A hypothetical situation in the present or future may or may not actually happen - the speaker presents it as hypothetical because he does not know or it depends on the actions of others. It could possibly happen or it may never happen. A hypothetical situation might mean asking a “what if” question. It might be a “suppose” or “if only” statement. Hypothetical situations are good teaching tools. Jesus often used them in his teaching.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * How would you communicate a “suppose” scenario that could happen right now?
  *How would your language express a situation that may or may not happen in the future?
  * Does your language have a special way of indicating a hypothetical situation in the past?

It is important in translation to be able to recognize a hypothetical situation in the text and use appropriate words or phrases. You may need to show the timing of the hypothetical situation (e.g. past, present or future). You may need to clarify that the scenario is only a possibility: that it might be true or not likely to be true; that it could possibly happen or would never happen.  Hypothetical situations may or may not imply emotions or reasons.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

1. Consider a hypothetical situation that **would never happen**:

In Luke chapter 18 verse 25 Jesus was teaching his disciples about how being rich can make it hard to enter God’s kingdom. To emphasize this, he said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to submit to God’s rule in their life.

The hypothetical part of this is that a large camel could never squeeze through the eye of a very small sewing needle! Jesus used this hypothetical scenario to emphasize his teaching point.

2. Consider a “suppose” scenario that **could possibly happen**.

In Matthew chapter 12 verse 11, Jesus was pointing out to the religious leaders that they were not being honest when they judged people for working on the Sabbath day. He told them, “Suppose one of you has a sheep and it falls into a deep hole on the Sabbath day. Certainly, you would work to pull it out of the hole!”

Jesus wasn’t talking about a specific person who did this. Rather, he was talking about a possible situation which could and often did happen. He used the hypothetical story to help listeners understand his own work (God's work).

3. The following is an example of a hypothetical scenario **in the past**:

In Matthew 11:21, Jesus said that //if the people living in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon had been able to see the miracles that he – Jesus – performed, they would have repented long ago.//

This is a hypothetical situation that we know did not happen. Jesus was making the spiritual teaching point of “what if” these people had seen the miracles? If they had seen the miracles, then, they would have repented.

4. Often a hypothetical situation in the past **expresses an emotion, such as regret**. For example, consider Exodus 16:3:

>“//If only we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt…//.”

Here the Israelites are afraid that they will have to suffer and die of hunger in the wilderness, and so they are wishing that they had stayed in Egypt and died there with full stomachs.
