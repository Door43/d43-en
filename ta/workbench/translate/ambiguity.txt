====== Ambiguity ======

Ambiguity happens when a single word or phrase can have more than one meaning.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

When translating, use source texts and any supplemental texts needed to make sure you understand the correct intended meaning.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Gen 5:24** //And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.//

In English, "God took him" can be a polite way to say he died. However, in the story of Enoch, Enoch did not die. Instead, God raptured him up. Therefore, this sentence could be misleading.

===== Examples from English =====

Ambiguity caused by a single word with two different meanings:

Jane works near the bank. Bank in English can mean the land next to a river or a place where money is kept.

Ambiguity caused by unclear sentence structure:

Tom saw the man with the binoculars. In this sentence, it is unclear who has the binoculars: Tom or the man. This sentence could mean that Tom used the binoculars so see the man or that Tom saw a man who was carrying binoculars.
