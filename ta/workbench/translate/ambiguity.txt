This module answers the question: What does ambiguity mean?\\
Ambiguity happens when a single word or phrase can have more than one meaning.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
When translating, use source texts and any supplemental texts needed to make sure you understand the correct intended meaning.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Gen 5:24** //And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.//
\\ 
In English, "God took him" can be a polite way to say he died. However, in the story of Enoch, Enoch did not die. Instead, God raptured him up. Therefore, this sentence could be misleading.
===== Examples from English =====

Ambiguity caused by a single word with two different meanings:\\
\\
Jane works near the bank. Bank in English can mean the land next to a river or a place where money is kept.\\
\\
Ambiguity caused by unclear sentence structure:\\
\\
Tom saw the man with the binoculars. In this sentence, it is unclear who has the binoculars: Tom or the man. This sentence could mean that Tom used the binoculars so see the man or that Tom saw a man who was carrying binoculars.
