===== Description =====

Pronouns are words that people use instead of a noun to refer to someone or something. There are six different types of pronouns.\\ 

**Personal Pronouns** show if the person is speaking, being spoken to or is spoken about. Frequently they also show number and/or gender and whether it is the subject: I, you, he, she, it, we, you, they or non-subject: me, you him, her, it, us, them. Here are some pages that will help you with personal pronouns. \\ 
**Person**: first, second, third \\

**Reflexive Pronouns** refer to another noun or pronoun in the same sentence.  ( See:  [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]]) \\ 

**Interrogative Pronouns** are used to make a question that needs more than just a yes or no for an answer: who, whom, what, where, how. \\ 

**Relative Pronouns** are used to mark a clause either to tell which noun out of a group is being referred to or, in some languages, to give added information about that the noun. In English we use the interrogatives pronouns or “that” to introduce a relative clause. \\ 

**Demonstrative Pronouns** are used to draw attention to an object, person or idea and to show distance from the speaker or another point of reference: this, these, that, those. \\ 

**Indefinite pronouns** are used when no particular noun is being referred to: any, anyone, someone, anything, something, some. Sometimes a personal pronoun is used: you, they, he or it.
