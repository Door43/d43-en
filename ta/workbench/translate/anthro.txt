====== zzz do not use Anthropomorphism ======

Anthropomorphism is when God or animals are given traits or behaviors that usually only humans have.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Anthropomorphism should not be taken literally.  The Bible is not saying that God has hands, or eyes, or ears, nor does he need to rest.  Instead, the Bible uses anthropomorphism to relate to his followers on human terms.
===== Examples from the Bible =====

Psalm 34:15 "__The eyes of the Lord__ are toward the righteous, and __His ears__ are open to their cry."
