Summary \\ 
A well translated parable is a story that makes truth easy to understand and hard to forget.



===== Description =====

Definition \\ 
A parable is a story told to teach a truth. While the events in the parable could happen, they did not actually happen. They are told strictly to teach a truth. Parables seldom contain the names of specific individuals (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable and what is a narrative account). \\  
(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
 \\ 
Example \\
**Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather, on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven. ** (Matthew 5:15-16) \\ 
=== Reason this could be a translation issue === 
Jesus taught many times by using parables; so much of the truth in the gospels is in parables. Therefore it is very important to know how to translate parables. \\

===== Examples from the Bible ===== 
**Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather, on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven.** (Matthew 5:15-16) \\ 
This parable teaches not hide your living for God from other people. \\   

** Then he also told them a parable. “Can a blind person guide another blind person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not?** (Luke 6:39) \\ 
This parable teaches that if you do not have spiritual understanding, you cannot help someone else to understand spiritual things. \\ 



===== Translation Strategies =====
Parables are told to teach a truth. If using the parable in your language would give the right meaning, consider using it. Otherwise, you could consider these strategies:
  -If the parable is hard to understand because it has unknown ideas in it; replace the unknown thing with something known in your culture, but be careful to keep the teaching the same. (See: Unknown Ideas)
  -If the teaching of the parable is unclear, consider putting a hint in the quote introducer such as “Jesus told this story about being generous.”


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
1. If your people do not know what a lamp stand is: \\ 
**Jesus said to them, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on a lampstand”**. (Matthew 5:15-16) \\ 
Jesus said to them, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on a high shelf. \\ 

If your people do not know what sowing is like: \\ 
**He said, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it? It is like a mustard seed, which when it is sown it is the smallest of all the seeds sown that lay upon the ground. Yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants. It puts out great branches, so even the birds of heaven can make their nests under its shade."** (Mark 4:30-32) \\ 
He said, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it? It is like a mustard seed, which when it is planted in the ground it is the smallest of all the seeds planted in the ground. Yet when it is planted, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants. It puts out great branches, so even the birds of heaven can make their nests under its shade." \\ 

2. If your people do not understand what this parable teaches: \\ 
**Jesus told them a story about why they should witness openly, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on a lampstand”**. (Matthew 5:15-16) \\ 

If your people do not understand what this parable teaches: \\ 
**He said, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it? It is like a mustard seed, which when it is sown it is the smallest of all the seeds sown that lay upon the ground. Yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants. It puts out great branches, so even the birds of heaven can make their nests under its shade."** (Mark 4:30-32) \\ 
He told them a story about how the Kingdom of God grows, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it? It is like a mustard seed, which when it is sown it is the smallest of all the seeds sown that lay upon the ground. Yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants. It puts out great branches, so even the birds of heaven can make their nests under its shade.” \\
