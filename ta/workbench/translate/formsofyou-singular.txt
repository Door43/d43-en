**He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.” When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “__You__ still lack one thing. Sell everything __you__ have and give to the poor, and __you__ will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” ** (Luke 18:21, 22)

The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. These languages both have a singular form of "you" and a plural form of "you." Therefore we know whether each “you” in the Bible should be singular or plural. But even when reading the Bible in a language that does not have distinct singular and plural forms of “you,” the context will often make it clear whether the word “you” is intended to refer to one person, to two people, or to more than two people. If the target language has a dual form of “you” that is used for speaking to only two people, the translator will need to decide from the context when it is appropriate to use this form.

Some languages, such as English, have only one word for "you," regardless of how many people are being spoken to. English speakers can refer to one person as "you" or to many people as "you." Often the context will make it clear as to whether the word "you" refers to one person or more than one. Looking at the other pronouns in the sentence will help you distinguish the number of people who are being spoken to.

Some languages have more than one word for "you," depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the singular form of "you." If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the plural form of "you." Some languages have a dual form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.

Note that for many languages, the decision about what form of the pronoun to use will also affect the form of the verb associated with it, even in cases where the word “you” is not expressed (for example when a command is given).



===== Examples from the Bible =====

**He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.” When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “__You__ still lack one thing. Sell everything __you__ have and give to the poor, and __you__ will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”** (Luke 18:21, 22)

Note that even though English does not have singular and plural forms of ‘you’, the context indicates that this word ‘you’ here only refers to one person. The man had just told Jesus “I have observed these things” and Jesus responded with “you”, referring only to that one man.

**Then the angel said to him, “Put on __your__ clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap __your__ cloak around __you__ and follow me,” the angel told him.** -Acts 12:8

The context makes it clear that the angel is addressing one person, so the singular form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. The verbs “put on“ and “wrap” would also need the singular form.

**To Titus, my true son in our common faith…The reason I left __you__ in Crete was that __you__ might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed __you__….__You__ must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.”** (Titus 1:2,5; 2:1)

Sometimes instruction is addressed to only one person, so the singular form of “you“ would be used. The context will make that clear. This often happens in a letter.
