====== zzz - DO NOT USE - Adjectival Noun ======

An **adjectival noun** is a noun that acts like an adjective and describes another noun. A **noun** is a person, place or thing. An **adjective** is a word that describes a noun. See the [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech|English Parts of Speech]] page for more complete information. A noun that describes another noun is acting like an adjective and so that is why it is called an "adjectival noun".

===== Translation Suggestions =====

When the adjectival noun shows 'ownership or belonging' use the noun and change the adjectival noun into an of noun phrase. For example, Gentile descendants is changed to 'descendants of Gentiles'. Using a possessive form of a noun is another possibility (e.g. Israel's camp) or saying the camp belonging to the Israelites work equally well. Instead of 'church building, one might say 'the building that belongs to the church.'

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Gentile descendants - Gentile is a noun (e.g. non-Jewish people). Descendants is also a noun (e.g. offspring). This adjectival noun example means descendants who are Gentile.

===== Examples from English =====

In the example, "Bible teacher" the adjectival noun is "Bible" because it describes the noun "teacher" and tells what kind of teacher it is. Another example of an adjectival noun could be "history" as in "history teacher" or "history lesson". Some languages do not use adjectival nouns and so would have to translate these using a phrase such as, "teacher who teaches the Bible" and, a "lesson about history". Other examples of an adjectival noun describing a noun include: church building; school bus, car door, desk chair and many others.

Note that another adjective may also be combined with an adjectival noun to describe a noun. For example: "yellow school bus" or "comfortable desk chair".
