Some images from the Bible involving body parts and human qualities are listed below in alphabetical order. The word in all capital letters represents an idea. The word does not necessarily appear in every verse that has the image, but the idea that the word represents does.


===An ANIMAL HORN represents strength===

> God is my rock. I take refuge in him.
> He is my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold, and my refuge, 
> the one who saves me from violence. (2 Samuel 22:3 ULB)

The "horn of my salvation" is the strong one who saves me.

>There I will make the horn of David to grow. (Psalm 132:17 ULB)

The "horn of David" is King David's military strength.

=== DANGEROUS ANIMALS represent dangerous people ===

A viper is poisonous snake that injects poison into a person or animal that it bites. They sometimes represent people who do evil and sometimes represent people who do evil things, and their POISON represents the evil acts or evil speech.

>He led his own people out like sheep and guided them through the wilderness like a flock. (Psalm 78:52 ULB)

===SHEEP or a FLOCK OF SHEEP represents people who are in danger ===
