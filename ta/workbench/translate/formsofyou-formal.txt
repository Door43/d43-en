====== Forms of "You": Formal or Informal ======

This module answers the question: How do you know if the word "you" is formal or informal?

Before you read this module, it would be helpful to learn about:

  * [Pronouns] [[en:ta:workbench:translate:pronouns|on Workbench]]

Some languages make a distinction between the formal form of "you" and the informal form of "you". In some cultures people use the formal "you" when speaking to someone who is older or in authority, and they use the informal "you" when speaking to someone who is their own age or younger or who has less authority. In other cultures people use the formal "you" when speaking to strangers or people they do not know well, and the informal you when speaking with family members and close friends.



Here is an example from the Bible of where languages that make this distinction would use the //formal// form of “‘you.”

**So, it seemed good to me also, having investigated everything accurately from the beginning, to write it down for  __ you __ in order, most excellent Theophilus. I ** ** want  __ you __ to know the certainty of the things that  __ you  __ were taught. ** ( Luke 1:3-4 ULB)

Theophilus was probably a high official, judging from the way Luke addresses him as “most excellent.” If so, in some languages, the formal form of “you” (here and in the surrounding verses) would be used.

=== It is obvious that using one form of "you" or another will influence the meaning of a text. Readers need to understand correctly the tone and relationships in a text. ===

=== Translation Principles (optional) ===
===== Examples from the Bible =====


===== Translation Strategies =====

You may be translating from a language like English, which does not use formal and informal forms of “you.” If your language has formal and informal forms, you may sometimes wonder what the relationship is between two people in the Bible in order to know which form to use. The translation notes will give you the information you need in order to make your decision. \\

Or you may be translating from a language that has formal and informal forms of “you,” such as Spanish and French. Even though these languages mark formal and informal “you,” you still may need to know the relationship between the people talking in order to know which form of “you” is best for your language. The rules in your language may not be exactly the same as those of the language you are translating from. So for you too, the translation notes will give you the information you need in order to help you make your decision.

The Formal 'You' is used when addressing someone in authority. The Informal 'You' is used when talking with a peer or someone with less authority. Most languages that make this distinction will use the formal form for strangers or people one does not know very well and/or to show respect to people of higher status.
