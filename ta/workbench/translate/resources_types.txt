===== Types of Notes =====

To translate from the ULB.
  * Read the ULB. Do you understand the meaning of the text so that you can accurately, clearly and naturally translate the meaning into your language?
    * YES? Start translating.
  * NO? Look at the UDB. Does the UDB help you understand the meaning of the ULB text?
    * YES? Start translating.
  * NO? Read the translation notes for help.

Translation Notes are words or phrases copied from the ULB and then explained. In English, the ULB text is in bold.\\

There are many different type of notes in the Translation Notes.

==== Definitions ====
Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULB means. Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence format. Here are examples:\\

  * **marketplace**  - a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods
  * **flute**  - a long, hollow musical instrument which is played by blowing air in or over one end
  * **kings' palaces**  - a large, expensive house that a king lives in

==== Explanations ====

Simple explanations about words or phrases are in sentence format. For example:\\

  * **washing their nets**  - They were cleaning their fishing nets in order to use them again to catch fish.
  * **motioned**  - They were too far from shore to call so they made gestures, probably waving their arms.

==== Suggested Translations ====
There are several types of suggested translations.

=== Synonyms and Equivalent Phrases ===
Synonyms and equivalent phrases are written in double-quotes. These mean the same as the text in the ULB. \\

In this example, the words "the path" or the words "the road" can replace the words "the way" in the ULB. You decide if it is natural to say path or road in your language.
  * **the way**  - "the path" or "the road"
In this example, the words "do the same thing" can replace the words "do likewise" in the ULB. You, as the translator, decide what is the natural for your language.
  * **do likewise**  - "do the same thing." 

=== Alternate Translation(s) ===

An alternate translation is a suggested change to the form or content of the ULB because the target language has a different form.

Examples include adding implicit information, changing passive voice to active, and stating rhetorical questions as statements. 

The "AT:" indicates that this alternate translation should only be used when the ULB form or content will not fit into the form of your language. Some examples are:

  * **see the salvation of God**  - AT: "learn about how God saves people from sin."
  * **Follow me**  - AT: “Be my disciple” or “Come, follow me as your teacher.”


=== Clarifying Translation in the UDB ===

There may be no note if the UDB provides a good alternate translation for the ULB. However, on occasion there may be text from the UDB as well as a suggested translation. There will be "(UDB)" after the text from the UDB as below:

  * **implored him**  - "begged him" or "pleaded with him" (UDB)
  * **he fell on his face**  - "he bowed down to the ground" (UDB) or "he knelt and touched the ground with his face"

=== Alternate Meaning(s) ===

Alternate **meanings** refer to 
  * When there are multiple ways to express something
  * When there are different understandings of what the word or phrase means. 
 
The explanation of the ULB text starts with the words "Possible meanings are" and number the translation suggestions with the preferred meaning first. If the meaning is given as an explanation, it is not in quotes. 
  * **You are like a young lion ... like a monster in the seas** - Possible meanings are that 1) he was like a lion and a monster or 2) he thought he was like a lion, but he was really only a monster.

  * **like a monster in the seas** - Possible meanings are that 1) he was powerful or 2) he was not doing anything important.

If the meaning is given in a way that can be used as a translation, it is in quotes. 

  * **fell down at Jesus' knees**  - Possible meanings are 1) "bowed down at Jesus' feet" or 2) "lay down on the ground at Jesus' feet" or 3) "knelt down before Jesus." Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.

=== Identify Figures of Speech ===

When writing a note to identify and explain a figure of speech, use sentence form and put the meaning in quotes.

  * **Make ready the way of the Lord**  - This phrase compares people preparing themselves for the arrival of the Lord to people who are repairing a road for someone to use it. AT: "Repent and be ready for when the Lord comes." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **You offspring of poisonous snakes**  - Jesus uses this expression to emphasize how dangerous the Pharisees are. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. AT: "You evil poisonous snakes!" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])

If there is a Translation Academy page that deals with a figure of speech, you can include it in the note. You can see the list of topics at: [[en:ta:ta-topics]]

  * Refer to tA topics by writing, for example, "(See: Metonymy)" or "(See: Exclusive)" at the end of the note. You can see these at [[:en:ta:ta-topics|Topics]].

=== Indirect to Direct Quote ===

When adding the option for a direct quote, preface the alternate with "It can be translated as a direct quote:" followed by the new phrase.

  * **to tell no one**  - This can be translated as a direct quote: "Do not tell anyone." The implied information is "that you have been healed." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations|Speech Quotations]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])


=== Multiple Notes on Long Phrase ===

Sometimes there are notes for a phrase and separate notes for portions of that phrase. In that case, the larger phrase is first, and its parts afterward. As in:

  * **you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man**  - This can be translated as an indirect quote: "you say that he is a gluttonous man" or "you accuse him of being a gluttonous man."
  * **he is a gluttonous man**  - "he is a greedy eater" or "he habitually eats too much food"
