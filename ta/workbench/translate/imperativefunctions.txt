==== Description ====

Imperative sentences are mainly used to express a desire or requirement that someone do something. Normally the speaker wants the listener to do something. Sometimes imperative sentences are used in the Bible for other functions.

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages would not use an imperative sentence for some of the functions that they are used for in the Bible.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Speakers often use imperative sentences to tell or ask their listeners to do something. In Genesis 2, God spoke to Isaac and told him not to go to Egypt but to live where God would tell him to live.

> Now Yahweh appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land that I tell you to live in. (Genesis 26:2 ULB)

Sometimes imperative sentences are used in the Bible for other functions. 

=== First Person Imperatives ===

Speakers sometimes use imperative sentences __to say what they want to do or what they want others to do with them__. In the ULB and UDB in English, this is shown with "let me" or "let us."  

In Genesis 21 Hagar did not want to watch while her son died. She was not telling someone else not to __let__, or allow, her to watch. She was expressing her own strong desire not to see it.
>__Let me not look__ upon the death of the child. (Genesis 21:16 ULB)

In Genesis 11, the people were saying that it would be good for them all to make bricks.
>They said to one another, "Come, __let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly__." (Genesis 11:3  ULB)

In Mark 1 Jesus expressed that he wanted his disciples to go with him to other places. 
>__Let us go elsewhere__, out into the surrounding towns, so that I may preach there also. That is why I came out here. (Mark 1:38 ULB)

=== Third Person Imperatives === 
Speakers sometimes use imperative sentences __to say what they want someone else to do or what what they want to happen__.  In the ULB and UDB in English this is usually shown with "may" or "let" before the one who is to do it.

In Luke 16 Abraham was not telling the rich man to allow his brothers to listen to Moses and the prophets. He was telling him that his brothers ought to listen to Moses and the prophets.
>But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the prophets; __let them listen to them__.' (Luke 16:29 ULB)

In Psalms, Solomon said what he wanted to happen.
>__May there be abundance__ of grain in the earth on the mountaintops (Psalms 72:16 ULB)

Blessings and curses are also third person imperatives in which a speaker says what he wants to happen to someone. 

In Genesis 28, Isaac blessed his son Jacob.
>May God Almighty bless you, make you fruitful and multiply you. (Genesis 28:3 ULB) 

In Deuteronomy the priests cursed anyone who would make and idol.
>__May the man be cursed__ who makes a carved or cast figure, something disgusting to Yahweh, the work of the hands of a craftsman, and who sets it up in secret.  (Deuteronomy 27:15 ULB)

In Genesis 9, Noah cursed Canaan, the descendants of his son Ham.
>__Cursed be Canaan__. May he be a servant to his brothers' servants. (Genesis 9:25 ULB)

=== Commands that do what they say=== 

God can cause things to happen by commanding that they happen. Jesus cleaned (healed) a man  by commanding that the man be clean (healed). They man could not obey the command, but Jesus caused him to be clean by commanding it.
> “I am willing. __Be clean__.” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. (Matthew 8:3 ULB)

In Genesis 1, God commanded that there should be light, and by commanding it, he caused it to exist.
>God said, "__Let there be light__," and there was light. (Genesis 1:3 ULB)

=== Imperative Sentences that Function as Conditions === 
An imperative sentence can also be used to tell the __condition__ under which something will happen.  The proverbs mainly tell about life and things that often happen. The purpose of Proverbs 4:6 below is no primarily to give a command, but to teach what people can expect to happen __if__ they love wisdom.

>do not abandon wisdom and she will watch over you; 
>love her and she will keep you safe. (Proverbs 4:6 ULB)

The purpose of Proverbs 22:6 below is teach what people can expect to happen __if__ they teach their children the way they should go. 

>Teach a child the way he should go,
>and when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction. (Proverbs 22:6 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====
  - If the function of an imperative sentence would not be understood correctly in your language, __use a sentence type__ that would express that function.
  - If the function of an imperative sentence would not be understood correctly in your language, __use a verb form__ that would express that function.
  - If the function of an imperative sentence would not be understood correctly in your language, __use pronouns__ that would make it clear.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ==== 

1. If the function of an imperative sentence would not be understood correctly in your language, use a sentence type that would express that function. The command below is used as a condition for what will happen, so it can be translated with the word "if."
>Teach a child the way he should go,
>and when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction. (Proverbs 22:6 ULB)

"__If__ you teach a child the way he should go,
when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction."

Since Jesus was cleansing the man by speaking to him, some languages might use a simple statement rather than a command.
  * **I am willing. Be clean.** (Matthew 8:3 ULB)
    * "I am willing. __I now cleanse you__." 

2. If the function of an imperative sentence would not be understood correctly in your language, use a verb form that would express that function.
  * **They have Moses and the prophets; __let them listen__ to them.** (Luke 16:29 ULB)
    * "They have Moses and the prophets; __they should listen__ to them."

3. If the function of an imperative sentence would not be understood correctly in your language, use pronouns that would make it clear.
  * **__Let us go__ elsewhere, out into the surrounding towns** (Mark 1:38 ULB)
    * "__Go with me__ elsewhere, out into the surrounding towns"
