====== Personification ======

**This module answers the question**: What is personification?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]
 
Personification is a figure of speech in which someone speaks of something as if it could do things that animals or people can do. People often speak this way because it makes it easier to talk about things that we cannot see, such as wisdom and sin. 
  * **Does not Wisdom call out?** Proverbs 8:1
  * **sin crouches at the door** Genesis 4:7
Some languages do not use personification, and some languages use it only in certain situations.



===== Description =====
Personification is a figure of speech in which someone speaks of something as if it could do things that animals or people can do. People often do this because it makes it easier to talk about things that we cannot see, such as wisdom, sin, and wind. For example: 
  * **Does not Wisdom call out?** Proverbs 8:1 
  * **sin crouches at the door** Genesis 4:7 
 
People also do this because it is sometimes easier to talk about relationships between people and other people than about relationships between people and non-human things, such as wealth.
  * **You cannot serve God and wealth**. Matthew 6:24

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages do not use personification. Some languages use personification only in certain situations.

===== Examples from the Bible=====
**You cannot serve God and wealth.** (Matthew 6:24) \\ 
Jesus speaks of wealth as if it were a master whom people might serve. Loving money and basing one's decisions on it is like serving it as a slave would serve his master.\\

**Does not Wisdom call out? Does not Understanding raise her voice?** (Proverbs 8:1) \\ 
The author speaks of wisdom and understanding as if they are a woman who calls out to teach people. They are not something hidden, but something obvious that people should pay attention to.\\

**Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.** (Proverbs 2:11) \\ 
The author speaks of discretion and understanding as if they could watch over and guard you. If you have discretion and understanding you will be safe because you will not do foolish things that could hurt you.\\

===== Translation Strategies =====
If the personification would not be understood clearly, here are some strategies for dealing with it.
  - Add implied information to make it clear.
  - Use the words “like” or “as” to show that the sentences is not to be understood literally. 
  - Find a way to translate it without the personification. 


===== Examples of These Translation Suggestions Applied =====
1. Add implied information to make it clear. \\ 
  * **sin crouches at the door** (Genesis 4:7) - God speaks of sin as a wild animal that is waiting for the chance to attack.  This shows how dangerous sin is. An additional phrase can be added to make this danger clear.\\
    * “sin is at your door, waiting to attack you”

2.  Use the words “like” or “as” to show that the sentences is not to be understood literally.  \\ 
  * **sin crouches at the door** (Genesis 4:7) - This can be translated with the word “as”.
    * “sin is about to destroy you, just as a wild animal could harm a person.”

3. Find a way to translate it without the personification. \\ 
  * **even the winds and the sea obey him**  (Matthew 8:27) - The men speak of the wind and the sea as if they are able to hear and obey Jesus as people can. This could also be translated without the idea of obedience by speaking of Jesus controlling them. \\
    * “He even controls the winds and the sea.”

**Note**: We have broadened our definition of "personification" to include "zoomorphism" (speaking of other things as if they had animal characteristics) and "anthropomorphism" (speaking of other things as if they had human characteristics).
