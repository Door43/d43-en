====== Personification ======

Personification is a figure of speech in which someone speaks of something as if it could do what animals or humans can do.
===== Examples of Personification from the Bible =====

**You cannot serve God and wealth.** Matthew 6:24.\\
Jesus speaks of wealth as if it were a master whom people might serve. Loving money and basing one's decisions on it is like serving it as a slave would serve his master.
 
**The wild animals of the field will honor me, the jackals and the ostriches.**  Isaiah 43:20 \\ 
God speaks of animals as if they could honor him by what they do or say. 
 
**Does not Wisdom call out? Does not Understanding raise her voice?** Proverbs 8:1  \\ 
The author speaks of wisdom and understanding as if they are a woman who calls out to teach people. They are not something hidden, but something obvious that people should pay attention to. 

**Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.** Proverbs 2:11 \\ 
The author speaks of discretion and understanding as if they could watch over and guard you. If you have discretion and understanding you will be safe because you will not do foolish things that could hurt you.


===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Use the personification if it would be understood correctly.
  * Use the words “like” or “as” to show that the sentences is not to be understood literally. See the example given below from Genesis 4.
  * If it would not be understood correctly, find a way to translate it without the personification. See the example given below from Matthew 8.
===== Examples of Translation Suggestions =====

**sin crouches at the door** Genesis 4:7 \\ 
God speaks of sin as a wild animal that is waiting for the chance to attack.  This shows how dangerous sin is. It can be translated as "sin is at your door, waiting to attack you" or "sin is about to destroy you, just as a wild animal could harm a person." 
 
**even the winds and the sea obey him**  Matthew 8:27 \\ 
The men speak of the wind and the sea as if they are able to hear and obey Jesus as people can. If this would not be understood correctly it could be translated as "He is so powerful that even the winds and the sea obey him" or "He even controls the winds and the sea."

Note: We have broadened our definition of "personification" to include "zoomorphism" (speaking of other things as if they had animal characteristics) and "anthropomorphism" (speaking of other things as if they had human characteristics).
