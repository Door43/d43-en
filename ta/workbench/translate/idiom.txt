An idiom is a word or phrase unique to a language or locality. An idiom has a special meaning distinct to the area in which the idiom was created by the people who first invented it. The meaning of an idiom is often only known to the people who live in the area in which it was created, because the idiom was invented there with a special usage and purpose in that language.

===== Description =====

An idiom is a word or phrase unique to a language or locality. An idiom has a special meaning distinct to the area in which the idiom was coined by the people who first invented it. The meaning of an idiom is often only known to the people who live in the area in which it was created because it was invented there with a special usage and purpose. 

All languages have unique idioms, although some idioms can have similar meanings to idioms of other localities and cultures. However, most idioms in one language or culture will probably need definition and explanation to people of other languages and cultures.

**Definition**: An idiom is a word or group of words that has a special meaning to the people of that language or culture. The meaning is different from what a person would understand from the meanings of the individual words.

**Example**: Jesus says in Luke 12:50 (ULB):\\ 
“But I have a __baptism to be baptized with__, and how I am distressed until it is completed!”\\
A “baptism to be baptized with” is an idiom here in this particular context for __suffering__. Jesus meant that he would soon suffer greatly. 
A “baptism” is an immersion into something, and Jesus was about to be immersed into the __suffering__ of the cross, and the rejection and mocking and torture that went with the cross.

**Purpose**: An idiom is created in a culture probably somewhat by accident when someone describes something in an unusual way. But, when that unusual way communicates the message powerfully and clearly (when understood), the unusual way of describing something in an idiom can become accepted and widely used. So, the purpose of an idiom is to say something strongly in a word picture that has been created to powerfully and effectively describe the message of the idiom.

=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===

Because the meaning of an idiom is unique to a language or particular locality within that language, a translator or native language speaker can very easily misunderstand an idiom from another culture. Without help, a reader will probably not understand most idioms in the Bible. So, translators must know that idioms exist, what they are, and familiarize themselves with many Biblical idioms. Translators must recognize any idiom that appears in the Bible and know how to discover what it means, and does not mean, before translating it.

=== Translation Principles ===


===== Examples from the Bible =====

“For you are all __sons of__ the light and __sons of__ the day. We are not __sons of__ the night or the darkness.”\\ (1 Thessalonians 5:5 ULB)\\
The phrase “sons of” here is a Hebrew idiom used to refer to people who have certain similar characteristics with each other. Jews used this idiom even when speaking Greek. “Sons of light” refers to people who live and act in the “light,” that is, the truth.
[[Susan, the Note for this verse does not label this an idiom. This seems to be an idiom to me. Should I add the link to “idiom” in the Note for this verse? Harry]]

“The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God. If children, then also heirs, heirs of God __on the one hand__, and joint heirs __on the other hand__ with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.”  (Romans 8:16, 17 ULB)\\
The phrase “on the one hand” … “on the other hand” is an idiom that contrasts or joins two different ways of thinking about or understanding something. This verse shows that the Spirit of God reveals to our human spirits as believers in Jesus that we are now children of God, and that also means that both God the Father and also God the Son have promised to give us great things as God’s children. We will take part in the glory of Jesus Christ because we now belong to him!\\
If your language has a similar idiom, you may use that to translate this idiom.\\ 
Some options to help translate this idiom include:\\
“heirs of God __on the one hand__, and joint heirs __on the other hand__ with Christ”\\
“__not only__ heirs of God __but also__ joint heirs with Christ”\\
“__both__ heirs of God __and__ joint heirs with Christ”\\
“we __not only__ have great promises from God, but we __also__ have great promises from Christ”

===== Translation Strategies =====
  * Use the original idiom if it would be clearly understood in your language.\\
  * Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.\\
  * Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.\\

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

  * Use the original idiom if it would be clearly understood in your language.
“When __day was breaking__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.”\\ (John 21:4 ULB)\\
The idiom “day was breaking” shows that it is very early in the morning and the sun was just coming up as the day was beginning. Many languages may easily understand this idiom.

  * Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.
“When __day was breaking__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.”\\ (John 21:4 ULB)\\
Your language may have a similar idiom with this meaning, something like:\\ 
“the sun was rising” or “daylight was appearing”

“Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, ‘Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel __in such and such a way__, but I have advised something else.’” (2 Samuel 7:15 ULB) 
The phrase “in such and such a way” refers to what Ahithophel had advised Absalom, which was previously recorded in the same chapter, in 2 Samuel 17:1-3. The writer does not repeat all that Athithopel had previously said, but instead he uses the idiom, “in such and such a way,” to refer to what was previously said. 
This idiom means that something was done or said that the hearer or reader should already know. So, instead of writing all that text over again, the writer refers to everything that was previously said with this idiom. This idiom also appear in English as, “this and that.”
If your language has an idiom with this meaning, you may use it.

An alternative way to translate this idiom in some contexts might be to simply not translate it. Leaving out the idiom, “in such and such a way,” in the verse above will not affect the meaning of the verse. 

  * Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.
“Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. He also saw the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh. They were ‘__born on his knees__.’”\\ (Genesis 50:23 ULB)\\ 
The phrase “born on his knees” is an idiom referring to an act in which Joseph placed these grandchildren of his on his knees at their birth to indicate a special promise to them to receive gifts from Joseph at his death.\\ 
If your language has a similar idiom, it could be used in your translation. If not, a translation indicating the meaning described here could be used without translating the literal words of the idiom, “They were born on his knees,” such as the UDB translates:\\ 
“they were recognized as being his descendants.”\\  
Or, something like:\\
“they were promised gifts from Joseph because they were his grandchildren,” or,\\
“they were blessed by Joseph and would inherit some of his wealth.”
