====== Writing Styles ======

Also known as 'Discourse.' Every story has a storyline. The storyline tells a series of events in chronological order and has a beginning, middle and end. It is full of types of words or phrases that moves the reader along the storyline.

For Example:

  * **Background Information**  - Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break usually contains background information.(See: [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:writingstyles_background|Writing Styles - Background Information]]) An author may use background information for several reasons: 1) to add interest to the story, 2) to provide important historical or cultural information or 3) to tell the reader, or listener, something very important.
  * **Therefore**  - The word 'therefore' is used to mark the conclusion or reason for a discussion. (See: [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:writingstyles_therefore|Writing Styles - Therefore]])
  * **Now**  - The word "now" at the beginning of the sentence …. (See: [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:writingstyles_now|Writing Styles - Now]])
