===== Description =====

The decimal point, or decimal comma, is a mark placed to the left of a numeral to show that the numeral refers to a part of something. For example .1 meter is not  a whole meter; it is one tenth of a meter. And .5 meter  is not five meters, but five tenths of a meter.  3.7 meters is three and seven tenths of a meter.  
 
In some countries people use a decimal point and in other countries people use a decimal comma. So people in countries that use a decimal comma would write "3.7 meters" as "3,7 meters." 
 
In some cultures people prefer fractions, another way of showing that a number refers to a part of something. (See: [[Fractions]])
