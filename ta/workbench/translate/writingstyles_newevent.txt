When people tell a story, they often put certain information at the beginning, such as who the story is about, when it happened, and where it happened. They may have a certain way of telling these things. For your translation to sound natural you may need to follow that way (or those ways of doing it.)

===== Description =====

When people tell a story, they tell about an event or a series of events. Often they put certain information at the beginning of the story, such as who the story is about, when it happened, and where it happened. New events in a story might involve new people, new times, and new places. Perhaps they might even tell if they saw the event or heard about it from someone else.

When your people tell about events, what information do they give at the beginning? Is there a certain order that they put it in? You may need to change how and in what order new information is introduced at the beginning of a new event in order for your translation to sound natural in your language.

Here are some examples of how some events are introduced in the ULB of the book of Matthew.

**__The birth of Jesus Christ happened in the following way.__ His mother Mary was engaged to marry Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.**  (Matthew 1:18)

**__After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king__, learned men from the east arrived in Jerusalem saying,…  (Matthew 2:1)

**In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying, …**  (Matthew 3:1-22) \\
This is the first time Matthew writes about John in this book. of John in the

**Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.** (Matthew 3:13)

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council. This man came to Jesus at night time** (John 3:1,2)\\
The author first introduced the new person and then told about what he did and when he did. In some languages it might be more natural to tell about the time first. 

**Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth.** (Genesis 7:6) \\
The story already told about how God told Noah that there would be a flood, and how Noah prepared for it. This sentence introduces the part of the story that tells about Noah and his family and the animals going into the ship, the rain starting, and the rain flooding the earth. Some languages might need to make it clear that this simply introduces the event. The people went into the ship before the flood came.
===== Translation Strategies =====
Consider how people who speak your language tell about events they have seen or done. How do they introduce a new story or a new part of story? What information do they give at the beginning? Is there a certain order that they put that information in? Information that people might normally put at the beginning includes who the story is about, what he did, when he did it, and where he did it.

If the information given at the beginning of a new event is clear and natural to your readers, consider translating it as in the ULB or UDB. If not, consider one of these strategies.

  - Put the information in the order that your people put it.
  - If readers would expect certain information but it is not in the Bible, consider using an indefinite word or phrase such as: another time, someone.
  - If the introduction is a summary of the whole event, use your language's way of showing that it is a summary. 
  - If your people would not give a summary at the beginning, hold off on telling about the event, or show that the event would actually happen later in the story.
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Put the information in the order that your people put it.
  *  **Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council. This man came to Jesus at night time and said to him …**  (John 3:1,2)
    * "There was a man whose name was Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish Council. One night he came to Jesus and said…" 
    * "One night a man named Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish Council, came to Jesus and said …" 

  * **As he passed by, __he saw Levi the son of Alpheus, who was sitting__ at the tax collecting place, and he said to him …**  (Mark 2:14)
    * "As he passed by, __Levi the son of Alpheus was sitting__ at the tax collecting place. Jesus saw him and and said to him …"
    * "As he passed by, __there was a man sitting__ at the tax collecting place. His name was Levi, and he was the son of Alpheus. Jesus saw him and said to him …"
    * "As he passed by, __there was a tax collector__ sitting at the tax collecting place. His name was Levi, and he was the son of Alpheus. Jesus saw him and said to him …"

2. If readers would expect certain information but it is not in the Bible, consider using an indefinite word or phrase such as: another time, someone.
  * **Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth.** (Genesis 7:6)
    * "__After that__, when Noah was six hundred years old, the flood came upon the earth."

  * **__Again__ he began to teach beside the lake.** (Mark 4:1)
    * "__Another time__ Jesus began to teach people beside the lake."

3. If the introduction is a summary of the whole event, use your language's way of showing that it is a summary. This is one way that it can be done in English.
  * **Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth.** (Genesis 7:6)
    * "__Now this is what happened when__ Noah was six hundred years old and the flood came upon the earth."

4. If your people would not give a summary at the beginning, hold off on telling about the event, or show that the event would actually happen later in the story.
  * **Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth. Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives went into the ark together because of the waters of the flood.** (Genesis 7:6)
    * "__Now this is what happened when__ Noah was six hundred years old. Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives went into the ark together because __God had said that the flood would come__."
