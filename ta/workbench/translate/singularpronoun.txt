This module answers the question: What are English singular pronouns?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech|English Parts of Speech]]

Singular pronouns replace singular nouns, which are those that name one person, place, thing, or idea.
==== Singular Personal Pronouns: ====

Personal Pronouns refer to people.

  * //1st Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **I**  or **me**  - refers to the //Speaker//
  * //2nd Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **you**  - refers to the //Addressee//
In Standard English, **you**  is also used to refer to many different people. Therefore, the [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive|exclusive]] or [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|inclusive]] of **you **  is based on context.

English has two gender-specific //3rd Person Singular Pronouns//  that depend on the sex of the individual referenced.

  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Masculine Pronoun: //**he **- refers to a male person
  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Feminine Pronoun: //**she **- refers to a female person
English has one gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun//, however, it can only refer to non-human things.

  * //3rd Person Singular Non-human Pronoun//: **it**  - refers to a singular thing
Often the word "they" is used in place of a singular pronoun such as "he or she" when the sex of the person is not important. For example: "If __a student__  wants to get a good grade on the test, then __they__  must study hard." \\  \\ Information on plural pronouns is here: **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pluralpronouns|Plural Pronouns]]**
