This module answers the question: What is a metaphor?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

==== Definition ====

A metaphor is a figure of speech in which something is spoken of as if it were something else. The speaker usually does this in order to help his audience understand something about which he is talking. 

Metaphors and similes are very much alike, except that in similes, the speaker uses a word such as "like" or "as" to warn the audience that he is going to speak about one idea as if it were another. In metaphor, the speaker does not give this kind of warning.
<del>


that creates a 'word picture' by relating one thing (the topic of the metaphor) to an unrelated object. Metaphors imply (or state directly) that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]].). A metaphor transfers an image from one familiar object to another object that is less easily understood.</del> 

Some metaphors are easy to identify, such as when Jesus calls King Herod a fox. But many metaphors have hidden foundations and are hard to identify. For example, someone may say, "Husbands and wives should walk together through life." The hidden foundation of this metaphor is the idea that **life is represented by the idea of a journey**. 

This hidden foundation can lead us to different related thoughts: husbands and wives should endure difficulties together, just as two people traveling together face the same difficulties. Husbands and wives should help each other, just as two travelers should help each other. 

<del>For example, "Life is a journey," is a metaphor that helps convey a concept about life - that it is like a journey in some way - perhaps because in both you are always moving along and progressing, not staying in the same place. In this example, "life" is the topic, "a journey" is the image that is being applied to the topic, and the concept of movement or progression is the point of similarity. Every metaphor has a topic, an image, and a point of similarity. But as with this example, usually the point of similarity is not stated.</del> 

Usually the speaker wants his audience to find out for themselves the hidden truth that he wants them to learn.

==== Purposes of Metaphor ====

  * One purpose of metaphor is to teach about something that is unknown by indicating that it is similar to something that is already known.
  * Another purpose of metaphor is to emphasize that something has a particular trait or to indicate that it has that particular trait in an extreme way.
  * Another purpose of metaphor is to lead people to react emotionally to one thing as they would to another.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * If the image in the original is unknown to your people, use an image from your own culture. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. We don't want to have comparisons to things that had not been invented when the books of the Bible were first written.
  * Or if the image in the original is unknown to your people, simply state the point of similarity without using an image.
  * If it would be unclear to your readers how the topic is like the image, you can state the point of similarity clearly. However, do not do this if it was also not clear to the original audience.
  * If the topic is not stated clearly in the original and it would be unclear to your readers what the topic is, state the topic clearly. However, do not do this if the topic was not clear to the original audience. For example, in Matthew 16:6, Jesus told his disciples "Beware of the __yeast__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees." His disciples thought he was talking about bread, but Jesus was warning them about the __teaching__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That was the topic, but it was unstated, and the disciples did not understand it at first. If the metaphor were fully stated, it would be, "The teaching of the Pharisees is like yeast." the point of similarity is that they both spread throughout whatever they touch and change it.
  * If the target audience would not understand the metaphor, then change the metaphor to a simile by adding "like" or "as".

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Jesus said to them. “I am the __bread of life__. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty." John 6:35 

Jesus compared himself to bread, a food that people ate all the time then. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.

>… __the rising sun will__  come from heaven to help us, __to shine__  on those who sit in __darkness__  and the __shadow of death__.  Luke 1:78b-79a

This verse has several related metaphors. The Savior is compared to the rising sun, teaching spiritual truth is compared to the sun shining, lacking spiritual truth is compared to sitting in darkness, and the fear of death is compared to a shadow. This means that just as the rising sun shines on those who have been living in darkness, the Savior will come and bring spiritual truth to those who lack spiritual truth and are afraid of death.

==== Examples from English ====

>"He was a walking __dictionary__."

Because he knows the meanings of so many words, he is compared to a dictionary. Dictionaries contain the meanings of many words.

>"Her __heart broke__ when her baby died."

Her heart, or emotions, is compared to a physical thing that can break.
