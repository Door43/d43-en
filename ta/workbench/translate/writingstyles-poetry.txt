=== Some places to look for poetry in your language === 
  - Songs, particularly old songs or ones used in children’s games
  - Religious ceremony or chants of priests or witch doctors
  - Prayers, blessings, and curses
  - Old legends

Popular orators in the language use elegant speech and is the probably the easiest source of text to study to find out what makes speech elegant in your language.

**Reasons this could be a translation issue:** \\ 
Different languages use poetry for different things. If a poetic form would not communicate the same meaning in your language you may need to write it without the poetry. \\ 
In some languages, using poetry for a particular passage would make the passage much more powerful.
