===== Biblical Imagery - tA - Cultural Models =====


The Scriptures also employ cultural models, which can be described as systems of thought that are more elaborate and more developed than the metaphorical patterns and metonymies presented above. Some of these models, at least, were employed extensively in the Ancient Near East, and not only among the Israelites.

 \\ **Model of Theophany (God revealing himself) **

 \\ Ps. 18:7-14 \\  \\  \\ **Model of God as a human being**

Although the Scriptures explicitly deny that God is a human being, he is often spoken of as performing human actions and having human emotions, etc. This kind of language is so general that the God-human model is often overlooked. Nevertheless, when the Scriptures say that God speaks, we are not to imagine, for example, that he has vocal chords that vibrate. Neither is it the case that when the Scriptures present us with language like the following (e.g., //The hand of God also came on Judah, to give them one heart to carry out the command of the king and leaders by the word of Yahweh//  –2 Chron. 30:12) , we are to attribute to God a physical hand.

We commonly say that //hand //  here is a case of metonymy. Certainly metonymy is involved in this case, but the figure of speech in 1 Chron. 30:12 must involve more than metonymy only. The notion of inducing //hand of God //  to represent divine agency and power can work only if the hand itself can be attributed to God, where //hand //  is then used as a metonym for //God//. But //hand //  cannot be **literally **  attributed to God, so it must be **metaphorically **  attributed to him. On what basis? On the only possible basis: on the model of God as a human being.

Consequently, we must regard //the hand of God//  in its sense of divine agency and power as actually an example of a **combination of a model, metonym, //and //  underlying metaphor**, rather than as a simple metonym. The model is **God as a human being**, the metonym is **hand standing for God**, and the underlying metaphor is** hand representing agency and power**.

**Model of God as a Warrior**

  * //For you will turn them back; you will draw your bow before them//. Ps. 21:12 (ULB)
 \\  \\ **Model of God as a King**

**The Wilderness as a Model for Distressing Situations** \\  \\  \\ **Containment Model of the Sun at Night**

  * //Yet their words go out over all the earth and their speech to the end of the world. He has pitched a tent for the sun among them. The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race//. Ps. 19:4-5 (ULB)
  * //In the womb of the dawn go out like the dew of your youth. //  Ps. 110:3c (ULB)
**Model of Blood as Life**

In this model, the blood of a person or an animal represents life.

  * //In this way, this person would not die by the hand of the one who wanted to avenge the blood of the person who was killed, until he stood before the congregation//. Josh. 20:9 (ULB)
If it is spilled, someone has killed.

If it is poured out, there is death.

If it cries out, nature itself is claiming vengeance (via Personification)

**Model of a country as a wife and of its god as her husband**

**Model of the Wind as futility**

**Model of covenants**

**Model of human warfare as divine warfare**

**Model of geographical boundaries as other constraints in life**

**Model of wellbeing as physical cleanliness, of evil as physical dirtiness**

**Model of honor and shame**

**Model of good as existing in limited amounts**

**Model of the evil eye**

Variations of this model are found in many parts of the world. In most of the cultures represented in the Bible, the model included the following elements:

  * People see objects, not because of ambient light reflected off them, but because of light that emerges from their eyes onto those objects. See, for example:
      * //The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light.//  Matt. 6:22 (ULB)
  * This emergent light carries with itself the viewer's character. See, for example:
      * //The soul of the wicked craves evil; his neighbor sees no kindness in his eyes.//  Prov. 21:10 (ULB)
      * //He said, "It is that which comes out of the person that defiles him. For from within a person, out of the heart, proceed evil thoughts…, envy //  [lit., //an evil eye//]…. Mark 7:21-22 (ULB)
  * The primary quality of a person with the evil eye is envy. See, for example:
      * //Is it not legitimate for me to do what I wish with my own possessions? Or is your eye evil because I am good?//  Matt. 20:15 (ULB, in a context in which the emotion of envy is present)
  * To look at a person with an evil eye is to lay a curse or enchantment on him. See, for example:
      * //Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? //  [Lit., //who has bewitched you with the evil eye?//]. Gal. 3:1 (ULB)
These elements come together in Luke 11:33-36 (ULB):

//No one, after lighting a lamp, places it in a dark closet or under a basket, but on a lampstand so that those who enter may have light.//

//Your eye is the lamp of the body. //// //

[Analogy of the eye to a lamp]

//When your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light.//

[Having a good eye is a sign that you have goodness within yourself (note the metaphor: LIGHT IS GOODNESS)]

//But when your eye is bad, your body is full of darkness.//

[Having a bad eye is a sign that you have evil within yourself (note the metaphor: DARKNESS IS EVIL)]

//Therefore, be careful that the light in you is not darkness.//

[Ensure that you have goodness and not evil within yourself]

//If then, your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, then your whole body will be like when a lamp shines its brightness on you.//

[The eye projects the goodness or evil that is inside the body onto whatever it gazes at. In this way, the eye bestows either a blessing or a curse. See the familiar OT expression, "If I have found favor in your eyes...".]

**Model of the nation of Israel as God's son**

  * //When Israel was a young man I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt. //  Hos. 11:1 (ULB)
