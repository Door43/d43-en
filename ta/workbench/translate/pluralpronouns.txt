  * [Pronouns] [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:pronouns|Pronouns]]

Plural pronouns take the place of plural nouns, which name more than one person, place, thing, or idea.

**Dual Pronouns:**

Unlike some languages, English does not have Dual Personal Pronouns, which refer to two people only. In English, if clarification is necessary, the following phrases are used:

  * 1st Person Dual: **we two**  or **we both**; **us two **  or **us both **  or** both of us**. These phrases can be [[https://door43.org/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_exclusive|exclusive]] or [[https://door43.org/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_inclusive|inclusive]], based on context.
  * 1st Person Dual: **you and I**. This phrase is strictly [[https://door43.org/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_inclusive|inclusive]].
  * 2nd Person Dual: **you two**  or **you both**  or **both of you**
  * 3rd Person Dual: **these two**  or **those two **

Plural Personal Pronouns: English has two distinct Plural Personal Pronouns:

  * 1st Person Plural Pronoun: **we**  or **us**. These pronouns can be [[https://door43.org/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_exclusive|exclusive]] or [[https://door43.org/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_inclusive|inclusive, ]]based on context.
  * 3rd Person Plural Pronoun: **they**  or **them**

In Standard English, “you” can be either singular or plural, based on context. For clarification, “all” is sometimes used to form expressions like “you all” or “all of you” in specifying 2nd Person plurality.

**Plural Indefinite Pronouns****//: //  **

English has two distinct Plural Indefinite Pronouns:

**Everyone**  or **everybody**  (from singular: **anyone**  and **anybody,**  or **someone **  and **somebody**). These words are usually inclusive.

**Plural Relative Pronouns: **

In English, the Relative Pronouns are:** who **  or** whom, whoever **  or **whomever**,** that**, and** which**. These also serve singular nouns, with no changes in the plural.

  * **The child __who__  went to the store got lost.**
  * **The children __who__  went to the store got lost.**
**Plural Possessive Pronouns:**

  * In English, the 1st Person Plural Possessive Pronoun is** our **  or** ours **  (from Singular: **my **  or** mine**). These pronouns can be exclusive or inclusive, based on context.
  * In English, the 3rd Person Plural Possessive Pronoun is** their **  or** theirs **  (from Singular: **his**,** her**, **hers**, or** its**). These pronouns can be exclusive or inclusive, based on context.
  * In English, the 1st Person Plural Possessive Indefinite Pronoun is** everyone's **  or** everybody's**. These pronouns are usually inclusive.
  * In English, the 1st Person Plural Possessive Relative Pronoun is** whose. **  As with** you**,** your **  or **yours**, it can be either Singular or Plural, based on context.

**Plural Reflexive Pronouns: **

  * The 1st Person Plural Reflexive Pronoun is **ourselves**. This pronoun can be exclusive or inclusive, based on context.
  * The 2nd Person Plural Reflexive Pronoun is** yourselves **  (from Singular:** yourself**).
  * The 3rd Person Plural Reflexive Pronoun is** themselves**.

**Reciprocal Pronouns: **

The phrases** each other **  and** one another **  are used as pronouns in describing interactions between multiple people. These words are usually [[https://door43.org/​en/​ta/​vocabulary/​inclusive|inclusive]]__.__

===== Examples from the Bible =====


===== Translation Strategies =====

On some rare occasions, a speaker will switch from using a plural "you" to a singular "you." In Deuteronomy, chapters 1-20, Moses addresses the Israelites in the plural "you" form in Hebrew but then shifts to singular "you" in verse 21 and back to plural form in verse 22. This shift usually goes unnoticed in English because it uses "you" for both singular and plural. But many languages do make a distinction. The translation strategy is to ignore the shift and keep all pronouns plural.
