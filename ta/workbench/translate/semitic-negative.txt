[[Summary of 100 words or less]]

 
==== Description ====
In some languages can use the word "not" to mean "less than." This is typical of Hebrew and other Semitic languages. Jewish people also did this when they spoke Greek. 

> Do __not__ store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal. (Matthew 6:19, 20)

"Do __not__ store up for yourselves treasures on the earth" is not an absolute command that prohibits setting aside money or goods for the future. Rather it means to focus less on earthly treasures and more on spiritual treasures. (Check with Jim to see if this is correct)

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>For you do not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;
>you have no pleasure in burnt offerings.
>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. 
>You, God, will not despise a broken and a contrite heart.  (Psalm 51:16, 17)

This means "you do not delight in sacrifices and burnt offerings as much as a broken spirit."


>Stop working for the food that perishes, but work for the food that endures to everlasting life which the Son of Man will give you, for God the Father has set his seal on him. (John 6:27 ULB)

This means "stop working so much for food that spoils and work more for the food that endures to everlasting life." (This example will be clearer if the ULB used an ordinary negative rather than "Stop".)


>"Yet I have loved Jacob, but Esau I have hated. (Malachi 1:2,3 ULB)
Check with Jim on  this. I'm not sure if this is Semitic negative, or simply that love means to be loyal to a covenant and hate is not have a covenant with .
