===== Description =====

As part of a discourse  (Writing Styles) page that tells about things that are off-topic 
 
 
The ULB and UDB use the following: \\  
**Long dashes** - for information that is immediately relevant to the rest of the passage and to separate a general topic from a statement about it that follows.  (We may need to ask Jim more about this. I'm not sure if these are two different uses or the same use described in two ways.) 
 
**Parentheses** - To show that some information is off-topic 
 
**Indentation** - To show that certain lines in poetry are parallel, or to show that a paragraph is quoted material. 
 
We probably won't need the page for "Parenthesis" 

Example(s)  (from the Bible, or short ones we make up--not from English literature)\\ 
Purpose (optional)  \\ 
**Reason this is a translation issue:** (recommended) \\

If (an) x would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it/one. If not, here [are other options / is another option] \\ 
//(Content writer, please replace x with the issue this page is about. Reword the two sentences as needed.)//
  - first strategy 
  - second strategy
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
A numbered list of examples that match the strategies above. Each strategy should have an example - even if the first strategy is to maintain the  form or figure. Each strategy should have only one  example because of  challenges with the Door43 formatting. \\ 
1. Copy of the strategy \\
