Hendiadys is when a speaker makes a single idea more forceful by connecting two nouns or adjectives with “and” when one of the words actually describes the other.

===== Description =====

Hendiadys is when a speaker expresses a single idea by connecting two words with “and” when one of the words actually describes the other.

**his own __kingdom and glory__** (1 Thessalonians 2:12)\\
Though "kingdom" and "glory" are both nouns, "glory" actually tells what kind of "kingdom" it is: it is a kingdom of glory or a glorious kingdom.

**Reason this is a translation issue**\\
Speakers of some languages can only connect certain kinds of nouns or certain kinds of adjectives with each other. Some languages do not have such things as nouns for actions ("run") or states ("death") or descriptions ("size"), or adjectives for states ("dead").

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**in truth and love** (2 John 1:3)\\
This is hendiadys because "truth" describes what God and Jesus are, but "love" tells what they do.

**if you are willing and obedient** (Isaiah 1:19)\\
This is hendiadys because "willing" speaks of a person's desires, while "obedient" speaks of a person's actions.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If leaving the hendiadys in would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing so. If not, here are other options:
  - Change nouns and adjectives to sentences.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Change nouns and adjectives to sentences.

  * **in truth and love** (2 John 1:3)
    * "because they are true and they love us"

  * **if you are willing and obedient** (Isaiah 1:19)
    * "if you obey willingly"
