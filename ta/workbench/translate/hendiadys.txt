  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

In hendiadys, a single idea is expressed with two words connected with “and” rather than using one word to modify the other.  Instead of using an adjective and a noun together, two nouns are connected by an and to make the meaning stronger.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * Translate both words.
  * Arrange the words so that it is clear that one word describes the other.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**for I will give you a __mouth and wisdom__ which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.** Luke 21:15a (WEB)\\
The word “mouth” here refers to “words,” or "what to say," and the phrase could be translated as “wise words” or "wise things to say".\\ 
\\ 
**to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into __his own kingdom and glory__.** 1 Thes 2:12 (WEB)\\
God's kingdom and glory are not two separate things that God calls us into. Rather his kingdom is glorious. The phrase "kingdom and glory" is an example of hendiadys. Some versions translate this as "glorious kingdom".
===== Examples from English =====
**Nice and soft** \\ 
means "nicely soft."\\ 
\\ 
**Sat and talked** \\
