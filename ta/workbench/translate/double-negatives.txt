===== Description =====


Most languages express the negative near the verb or at the beginning or end of the sentence. Some languages also have prefixes or suffix that express the negative as in  “__un__happy,” “__im__possible,” "use__less__." Some languages can also express the negative in pronouns like “none,” “nothing,” and “no one,” in adverbs like “nowhere,” and in prepositions like "without."

A double negative occurs when a sentence has two words that express the meaning of "not".

**It is __not__ that we do __not__ have authority** (2 Thessalonians 3:9) \\ 
**we do __not__ have a high priest who can__not__ feel sympathy**  (Hebrews 4:16) 
**And this better confidence did __not__ happen __without__ the taking of an oath,** (Hebrews 7:20) \\
**Be sure of this—wicked people will __not__ go __un__punished** (Proverbs 11:21)

=== Reason this is a translation issue === 
Double negatives mean very different things in different languages. 
  * In some languages, such as Spanish, a double negative emphasizes the negative. The following Spanish sentence “No ví a nadie.” has both the word 'no' next to the verb and 'nadie' that means “no one.” It emphasis the negative. 
  * In some languages a double negative simply means a positive. So "She is not unattractive" means that "She is attractive." 
  * In some language the double negative weakens the adjective. So "She is not unattractive" means that "She is a little bit attractive." 
  * In some languages, such as the languages of the Bible, the double negative often strengthens the adjective. So "She is not unattractive" means that "She is very attractive."

To translate sentences with double negatives accurately and clearly in your language, you need to know what a double negative means in the Bible and how you express this same idea in your language. 

===== Examples from the Bible =====


**so that they may __not__ be __un__fruitful.** (Titus 3:14)  \\ 
This means "so that they will be fruitful."
  “so they will be fruitful” or “so they can produce fruit for God” or “so their lives will be useful.” 

**For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was __not useless__** (1 Thessalonians 2:1)
By using a double negative, Paul emphasized that his visit with them was very worthwhile. 

**All things were made through him and __without__ him there was __not__ one thing made that has been made.** (John 1:3)
By using a double negative John emphasized that the Son of God created absolutely everything.


===== Translation Strategies =====

If double negatives are natural and are used to express the positive in your language, consider using them.  Otherwise, you could consider these strategies:

  - If the double negative simply expresses the positive, remove the two negatives.
  - If the double negative emphasizes the positive, remove the two negatives and put in a strengthening word or phrase such as "very" or "surely."

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. If the double negative simply expresses the positive, remove the two negatives.

  * **For we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses** (Hebrews 4:15)
    * "For we have a hight priest who can feel sympathy for our weaknesses"
  * **so that they may not be unfruitful** (Titus 3:14) 
    * "so that they may be fruitful"

2. If the double negative emphasizes the positive, remove the two negatives and put in a strengthening word or   phrase such as “very” or “certainly.”
  * **Be sure of this—wicked people will __not__ go __un__punished** (Proverbs 11:21)
    * "Be sure of this—wicked people will __certainly__ be punished"

  * **All things were made through him and __without__ him there was __not__ one thing made that has been made.** (John 1:3) 
  * "All things were made through him. He made absolutely everything that has been made."
