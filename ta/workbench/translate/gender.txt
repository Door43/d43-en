===== Description =====

In some languages a word that normally refers to men is used to refer to a group of people, even though that group might have females in it. For example, in some languages, the word 'brother' usually refers to a male. There is a separate word for 'sister,' and it refers to a female. But the plural form 'brothers' can be used to refer to a group that has only males in it, or to a group that has both males and females. 

However some languages cannot use the word "brothers" to refer to a group of both males and females. They use the word "brothers" only to refer to a group of males. When they want to refer to a group of both males and females, they use "brothers and sisters."

Also in some languages "he" can be used for any person if the gender of the person is not important,  but in other languages, "he" could only refer to a male. (What I wrote below is not a real example -- just an idea. )
  * Whoever does ..., he will ...' 
  * Whoever does ..., they will  ... -  To avoid the impression that "whoever" and "he" could only refer to a male, English uses "they" because it does not show gender.

**Translation Principles**


===== Examples from the Bible =====
Matt 7:24 “Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. (New Living Translation) 

Matt 16:24-26 "Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it. What good will it be for a man, if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?'" (New International Version)
