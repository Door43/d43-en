  * [[en:ta:vol1:process:pretranslation_training|Training Before Translation Begins]]

Obtain the files in the .txt format.

For the English version of the files:
  - Go to [[en:home]].
  - Download the zip file from the Downloads Section in the left column on Door43.
  - Extract the files from the zip file. Remember where the extracted files are stored on the computer.

==== Translate the files in Notepad++ ====
  - Open Notepad++ using the icon or program listed on the Windows Start menu.
  - Select Open from the File menu.
  - Navigate to where the files are:
    - For tN - go to the bible folder and open the notes folder. The Notes for each book is in the book's name folder. (Each book has a folder for each chapter.)
    - For tW - go to the OBE folder and open the KT or Other folder
    - For tQ - go to the bible folder and open the Questions folder and then the Comprehension folder. The tQ for each book is in the book's name folder.
  - Open the desired file.
  - Edit the document and save with the same file name and as a .txt file.

==== What to translate ====

=== For translationNotes ===

Do not remove or change any equal signs ==. 

Do not translate the section between the formatting with 5 equal signs, the initials 'TFT:', then 5 equal signs and the formatting of 5 equal signs, the words 'Important Terms:' followed by 5 equal signs.

Replace every instance of ':en:' with '://your language code//'. Using Espanol as an example: you would replace ':en:' with ':es:' (es is the language code for Espanol.)

Notes are specific to the ULB translation. See the page on 'How to Write Notes' for more information.

Delete '2 squiggle lines before, the word 'DISCUSSION', and the 2 squiggle lines after'.

=== For translationWords ===

Do not remove or change any equal signs ==. 

The translators only need to translate words outside of square brackets [ ] and squigly brackets { }.

The words 'Definition', 'Translation Suggestions:', and 'Bible References:' appear on all tW pages. Your translation team members should use the same translation of these words on each tW page.

Replace every instance of ':en:' with '://your language code//'. Using Espanol as an example: you would replace ':en:' with ':es:' (es is the language code for Espanol.)

Delete '2 squiggle lines before, the word 'DISCUSSION', and the 2 squiggle lines after'.
