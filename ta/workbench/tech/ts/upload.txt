===== Upload Your Work =====

When you work in translationStudio, your text is saved every five seconds to your device. Your work is not saved to Door 43 until you upload it.

To upload your work:

  - In the green bar at the top of the screen, tap on the three dots on the right.
  - In the list of options, tap **Upload**.
  - The **Translation Upload**  screen opens. It shows the details of the project you will upload.
  - If you have completed the translation of this project, tap the slide bar on the right. Otherwise continue to step 5.
      - The slide bar should turn blue and the text should say, "We will now perform a few checks to ensure your translation is ready."
      - Tap **Continue ** at the bottom of the screen to run the checks on your translation.
      - If there is a problem, you will see an exclamation mark withe in a circle.  Tap the exclamation mark.  You will need to address each issue before you can continue with your upload.  Tap **Cancel ** to go back and correct your work.
  - If you are ready to transmit your work, tap **Continue**  to perform the upload.
