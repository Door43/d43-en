====== translationStudio-Desktop Introduction =====

The translationStudio Desktop program is designed for the Gateway Languages to translate not only the ULB, UDB into their language but also a place to translate all of the resources that the other languages will use to accurately translate the Bible. 

It can be downloaded on Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating systems. While the user can work in the program offline, information and finished content can be uploaded to Door43 when connected to the Internet.
