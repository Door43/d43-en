//This answers the question:// //How do I translate the UDB into the Gateway Language?//

  * //[[en:ta:vol3:gateway:gl_udb|Translating the UDB]]//
  * //[[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_install|translationStudio-Desktop v7 Installation]]//

It is important that you have read and understood the information about [[en:ta:vol3:gateway:gl_udb]] before continuing. 

**Note**: Only the Gateway Languages need to create a separate Unlocked Dynamic Bible.

==== Translating the Text ====

As you translate, be sure that you:
  * pray that God would help you make an easily-understandable, Scripturally-accurate translation
  * always do your translation according to the Translation Guidelines (see [[:en:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines]])
  * always do your translation according to the Statement of Faith (see [[:en:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith]])
  * use the translationNotes, the translationWords, the translationQuestions, and the Unlocked Literal Bible  to help you make a better translation

==== Create Translation Text ====

Creating an UDB in the Gateway Language is much like creating an ULB translation. Please see:  [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_create]] and [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_translate]] for more information.

=== There are several differences: ===

The translator can choose between **two source** translations. The ULB or the UDB. You might want to choose both by clicking in the empty square. Click on 'Confirm' to close the window.
  * At any time either souce text can be viewed. Click the tab of  the UDB or the ULB tab to view that text.

In the **Check** view the source text is on the left, the translation work is in the middle. 
  * When viewing the ULB as the source text - the UDB and all of the translationNotes, translationWords and translationQuestions are shown in the translation helps. See [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_resources]] for more information.
  * When viewing the UDB as the source text - all of the **ULB** translationNotes, translationWords and translationQuestions are shown in the translation helps. 

==== Save Translation Text ====

Go to [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_backup]] to learn how to manually save the translation work to the computer.

Your work is not saved on unfoldingWord until you upload your work. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_d43publish]])

==== Delete Translation Text ====

If you accidentally delete a large amount of work, contact [[help@door43.org]].
