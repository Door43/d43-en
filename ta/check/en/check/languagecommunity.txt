===== Community check =====

After you, the translation team, have performed the checks listed under Level One, you are ready to take the translation to the community so that you can check to see if it communicates the message clearly and naturally to them in the target language. There are a set of questions and answers for each Open Bible Story and for each chapter of the Bible that you can use to test how clear the translation is.[[:en:ta:check:en:check:1|[1]]] [link] To use these questions, follow these steps.

  - Read the passage to one or more members of the language community who will answer the questions. These members of the language community must be people //who have __not__  been involved in the translation before//. In other words, the community members who are asked the questions should not already know the answers to the questions from working on the translation or from previous knowledge of the Bible. We want them to be able to answer the questions only from hearing or reading the translation of the story or Bible passage. This is how we will know if the translation is communicating clearly or not. For this same reason, //it is important that the community members __not__  look at a Bible while they are answering these questions//.
  - Ask the community members some of the questions for that passage, one question at a time. It is not necessary to use all of the questions for each story or chapter if it seems that the community members are understanding the translation well.
  - After each question, a member of the language community will answer the question. If the person only answers with a “yes” or a “no,” then the questioner should ask a further question so that he can be sure that the translation is communicating well. A further question could be something like, “How do you know that?” or “What part of the translation tells you that?”
  - Write down the answer that the person gives. If the person’s answer is similar to the suggested answer that has been provided for the question, then the translation of the story is clearly communicating the right information at that point. The answer does not have to be exactly the same as the suggested answer to be a right answer, but it should give basically the same information. Sometimes the suggested answer is very long. If the person answers with only part of the suggested answer, that is also a right answer.
  - If the answer is unexpected or very different than the suggested answer, or if the person cannot answer the question, then the translation team will need to revise the part of the translation that communicates that information so that it communicates the information more clearly.
  - After the translation team has revised the translation of the passage, then ask other members of the language community the same questions, that is, ask other speakers of the language who have not been involved in checking the same passage before. If they answer the questions correctly, then the translation is now communicating well.
  - Repeat this process with each story or Bible chapter until members of the language community can answer the questions well, showing that the translation is communicating the right information clearly.
  -

Answer the following questions on Door43. The answers to these questions will help those in the wider Christian community know that the audience finds the translation to be clear, accurate, and natural.

  - Have you tested the translation by reading it to your community members and asking for feedback?
  - Were you able to use this information to make the translation clearer and easier to understand?
  - List a few passages where the community feedback was helpful. How did you change these passages to make them clearer?
  - Write an explanation for some of the Important Terms, explaining how they are equal to terms used in the national language. This will help the checkers understand why you chose these terms.
  - Does the community verify that there is a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud? (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?)

The community leaders might want to add additional information or make a summary statement about how acceptable this translation is to the local community. This can be included as part of the Level Two checking information. The wider church leadership will have access to this information, and it will help them validate the translation as approved by the wider Christian community in Level Three Checking.

[[:en:ta:check:en:check:1|[1]]] If specific questions are not available, you can ask questions like the following to see if the translated message is clear. For this section of testing, do __not__  compare the new translation with the national language translation.

  - Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message understandable? (Are the words confusing, or do they tell you plainly what the translator means?)
  - Does the translation use words and expressions that are normal for your community, or has the translator borrowed many words from the national language? (Is this the way your people talk when they want to say important things in your language?)
  - Can you read the text easily and understand what the writer might say next? (Is the translator using a good style of telling the story? Is he telling things in a way that makes sense, so that each section fits with what came before and what comes after?)
  - Does each section fit well with the sections before and after it, or is it sometimes difficult to tell how the sections connect? (Did the translator use the right introduction or connection words at the beginning of sections?)
  - Does the translation introduce the people in the story and refer to them in a way that is normal for stories in your language? (Is it difficult to tell who is doing or saying some of the things in the story?)
  - Another way to determine if the text is clear is to read a few verses at a time out loud and ask someone listening to retell the story after each section. If the person can easily restate your message, then the writing is clear.
