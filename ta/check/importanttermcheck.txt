===== How To Do an Important Term Check =====

  - Make a list of the Important Terms in the story or Bible passage that you translate, along with the term that you choose for it in the target language.
  - Each time the Important Term occurs in the source text, make sure that the word you have chosen for the translation still makes sense in that context. If it does not, discuss the problem with others on the translation team and try to find a solution together. You may need to use a different term, or you may need to use more than one term for the different contexts, or you may need to find another way to communicate the Important Term, such as using a longer phrase.

[We should have a place for them to keep a master list on Door43, so the list will be easy to manage and they can avoid duplicating words and lists of words. Or do we already have a master list on Door43? Can we also have a way for them to do a search on the words in order to do a consistency check?]
