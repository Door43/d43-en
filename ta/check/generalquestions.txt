===== General Questions =====

If specific questions are not available, you can ask questions like the following to see if the translated message is clear. For this section of testing, do __not__ compare the new translation with the source language translation.

   - Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message understandable? (Are the words confusing, or do they tell you plainly what the translator means?)
  - Does the translation use words and expressions that are normal for your community, or has the translator borrowed many words from the source language? (Is this the way your people talk when they want to say important things in your language?)
  - Can you read the text easily and understand what the writer might say next? (Is the translator using a good style of telling the story? Is he telling things in a way that makes sense, so that each section fits with what came before and what comes after?)
  - Does each section fit well with the sections before and after it, or is it sometimes difficult to tell how the sections connect? (Did the translator use the right introduction or connection words at the beginning of sections?)
  - Does the translation introduce the people in the story and refer to them in a way that is normal for stories in your language? (Is it easy to tell who is doing or saying some of the things in the story?)

Another way to determine if the text is clear is to read a few verses at a time out loud and ask someone listening to retell the story after each section. If the person can easily restate your message, then the writing is clear.
