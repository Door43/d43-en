===== Create and Edit Text =====

This page tells how to create and edit text in translationStudio. The video {{:en:ta:tech:translating_in_ts_-_obs_v2.mp4|Translating in translationStudio}}  shows how to navigate to the scripture you want to translate and begin working. Or see Navigate in translationStudio.

==== Create Translation Text ====

To create a new chapter in your language, navigate to the desired chapter and tap on the **Edit Screen**. The keyboard will open and you can begin working. When you are finished working, you can navigate to a different chapter or exit the app.
==== Save Translation Text ====

Every five seconds, your work is saved automatically in your device memory. Your work is not saved permanently until you upload your work. See __[[:en:ta:tech:ts:upload|Upload Your Work to Door43]]__.

==== Edit Translation Text ====

When you use translationStudio, you have the ability to create and change text on any page. So to edit existing work that you or another translator created, just navigate to the chapter and tap on the translation side of the page. Your work will be saved automatically every five seconds.

When you are finished working, you can navigate to a different chapter or exit the app.

==== Delete Translation Text ====

If there is a situation where you feel that a large amount of work must be deleted, such as an entire chapter, please contact your superior. Do not remove large amounts of text without discussing it first, even if you feel that a mistranslated key word has caused a significant problem. Your superior may know of another way to handle the issue without deleting previous work.

If you accidentally delete a large amount of work, contact your superior.
