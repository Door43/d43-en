====== Word Order ======

A basic sentence has three important parts: subjects, objects and verbs.  Both subjects and objects are usually nouns (i.e. a person, place, thing or idea). Verbs show action or a ‘state of being.’
  * The subject of a sentence is what the sentence is about.
  * The subject (which will be a noun: a person, place, thing or idea) is usually  the main “actor” in a sentence.
  * The “actor” or subject usually does or is “being” something.
When the subject is identified, determine what it is doing (or what is happening to it). Subjects can be in a **state** such as “happy,” “sad,” or “mad.”   Or the subject may be active: it can **perform** or **do** something such as “sing” or “work” or “teach.”  A subject may even have something done to it. For example, “The ball was thrown.” (The ball is the subject.) A recipient in a sentence (that is NOT the subject) is known as an object.  The object will also be a person, place, thing, or idea. In a simple sentence the subject usually does something to or towards an object. Consider the sentence: '//The boy kicked the ball//.'The boy is the **subject**; the recipient or **object** is the ball.  The subject (boy) does some **action** (kicked) to the object (ball).The VERB tells what the subject is doing (or being). Often it is easy to find the verb, because one looks for the action occurring in the sentence.  

===== Translation Suggestions =====

All languages have a preferred word order. Translate sentences so that they are accurate and have a smooth flow.

Word order or patterns can vary if the sentence:

  * is a question
  * has descriptive words
  * has a place in it
  * has time in it
  * has a condition in it, such as the word “if”
  * is a poem

Sometimes the word order will also vary if there is a special type of emphasis. For example, perhaps in your language there is a special way to ask a rhetorical question or give a command. Knowing the basic word order of the source text can help a translator in translating from that language into the target language. This is especially true if your language does not have the same pattern. If the two languages have a completely different word order, then often more rephrasing will be needed to make your translation sound natural. The translator’s goal is always to use natural language to make the meaning clear.

===== Language Examples =====

Now we will look at the importance of word order.

=== English: ===

In English, “The boy kicked the ball”. “The boy” is the subject, “kicked” is the verb, and “the ball” is the object.

This is the basic word order that English uses. First we say the subject, then the verb, and then the object. We can represent the Subject, Verb and Object with the letters “S”, “V” and “O”. So, we can call English an **SVO** Language.
=== Japanese, Chines, Dutch and Turkish ===

In the Japanese, Chinese, Dutch, and Turkish languages usually the subject is first, and then the object comes next, followed by the verb.

So the basic word order for a simple sentence for these languages is: SOV Subject – Object – Verb

=== Hebrew and Arabic ===

Verb – Subject – Object word order is common in Hebrew and Arabic languages.
