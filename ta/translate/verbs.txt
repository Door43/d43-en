====== Verbs ======

Verbs either link the subject to a descriptive portion of the sentence or express an action or a state-of-being (e.g. am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). Many languages use more verbs than English does. <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate.</font>

Events are usually expressed by **VERBS**.

The context of the sentence determines the type of verb because some can function in different ways. For example, "The fish tasted oily," uses tasted as a linking verb that describes the subject (the fish). "John tasted the fish" uses tasted as an action verb showing what the subject (John) did.

Some verbs require a 'helper' and thus become a verb phrase. Examples include: am eating, are running, have been eating, will be eating.

==== Verb Tense ====

Just as time can be expressed as past, present and future, verbs also have these tenses. The verb reflects when the action takes place. Perfect tenses of verbs indicate continuing action (either continuous from a time past or continuous into the future).

==== Verbs and Objects ====

All sentences have a SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT), VERB (EVENT), and OBJECT (PARTICIPANT). English grammar allows for not stating the object of the verb so that the sentence may only have the SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT) and VERB (EVENT) stated.\\
Examples:

  * '//He has been **singing**  for three hours//.' the object is not stated.
  * '//He has been **singing**__hymns__  for three hours.//' states 'hymns' as the object of "singing."

Note that different languages have different [[:en:ta:translate:wordorder|orders]] for these parts of the sentences.

In your language, all the verbs may require an object. (In the examples below, the subject is first, the verb is bold, and the object is underlined.) In English, it is sometimes ok to leave out the object when the object is not important in the sentence.

  * He **sang**__a____ song__.
  * He likes to **sing**.

In some languages, a verb that needs an object must always take one, even if the object is not very important. In all of these sentences, English can leave out the object.

  * He likes to **sing**__songs__.
  * He likes to **cook**__food__.
  * He has not **eaten**__anything__  in three days.
  * He is blind. He cannot **see**__anything__.

Sometimes you may need to include an object even if there is no object in English.

==== Singular & Plural Subjects - Verb Agreement ====

Nouns and Pronouns have the ability to be either singular (meaning "one") or plural (meaning "more than one"). For the majority of English words, plurals are formed simply by adding an 's' to the root word.

The [[singularpronoun|Singular Pronouns]] & [[pluralpronouns|Plural Pronouns]] pages have more information. Basically, singular pronouns include I, you, he, she and it. Plural pronouns include you, they and we. "It" refers back to nouns (the antecedent) which are non-human. There are collective nouns which describe quantities in excess of one but which remain singular in treatment; for example, team refers to several people. However, in a sentence, team is singular. (e.g. The team is tired.)

Verb agreement requires matching singular subjects with singular verbs. An example:

  * 'The voter is angry.' One voter (singular) uses a singular verb (is).
  * 'The voters are angry.' Many voters (plural) uses a plural verb (are).

Most of the time in English:

  * Nouns that are plural have an 's' on the end; verbs that are plural do not.
  * Singular verbs typically have an 's' on the end and their subject will not (e.g. A dog eats. Two dogs eat.)

Pronouns work the same way; it is important to use the right verb for each of the pronouns. The chart below shows the "Be" verb (in present and past tense) with each of the pronouns; the first four are singular in form and the remaining ones are plural.

|**Pronoun**   |**Present**   |**Past**   |
|I |am |was |
|he |is |was |
|she |is |was |
|it |is |was |
|you |are |were |
|they |are |were |
|we |are |were |

==== Modal Verbs ====

A special group of verbs called //**modal verbs**// create special challenges. These verbs function in different ways in sentences; their purpose can only be determined in context. Modal verbs can be used to convey responsibilities, expectations, inferences, possibilities or needs. Several examples are giving below under **English Oddities**.

Modal verbs include: can, may, must, should, would

==== Some English Verb Oddities ====

**Can and May**. The verb "can" shows ability or power; "may" is a modal verb involves permission or possibility. Examples:

   * 'I can read' states a fact.
  * 'May I read now?' seeks permission to read.
  * 'That may be perfect' means 'It could be perfect.'

 \\ **Must. **  Like 'can' and 'may' this is a 'modal verb.' The context of the sentence is important to understanding the meaning. **//Must//** can show an obligation or an opinion/assumption of the speaker.

  * I **must **  call my pastor. In this case, //must //  indicates a responsibility.
  * He **must**  be overwhelmed with calls. In this sentence, //must//  indicates a strong assumption/belief about the person spoken of.

 \\ **Has to. **  This is another modal verb that must be considered in context. It can denote obligation, opinion/inference/assumption or need.

  * He has to finish the test. (Obligation)
  * He has to be nearly done. (Inference/assumption)
  * He has to have insulin. (Personal need)

**Teach and Learn**. These verbs are partners. Teaching imparts knowledge. Learning means getting knowledge.

**Sit, Sat and Set**. These verbs are often confused. "Sit" is used to convey resting or being seated. "Set" means to place something. "Sat" is the past tense for sit. "Set" stays the same in both present and past tense. Examples:

  * 'I sit on a chair.' means 'I rest on a chair.'
  * 'I set my book on the table.' means 'I place my book on the table.' (or, 'I placed my book on the table')
