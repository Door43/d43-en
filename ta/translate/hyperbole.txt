====== Hyperbole ======

A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Keep the hyperbole if it would not misunderstood or thought to be a lie.
  * Express the meaning without the hyperbole. For example "All the people" could be translated as "large crowds of people"
  * If you decide to express the meaning without the hyperbole, be sure that it truly is hyperbole. God does miraculous things. Don't assume that just because something seems to be impossible, it could not have happened.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**When the sun was setting, __all__ those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.** Luke 4:40\\
Luke wrote that "all" brought their sick ones to Jesus. This is a hyperbole. Probably not everyone did this. But many did. The hyperbole helps to show how excited people were that Jesus could heal them and that a large number of them came to him to be healed.

**When they had brought their boats to land, __they left everything__, and followed him.** Luke 5:11\\
Luke wrote that when Jesus invited some fishermen to follow him, they left everything. We know that they left their fishing business. Saying that they left "everything" may be a case of hyperbole to emphasize that now they were completely committed to following Jesus.


===== Examples from English =====

**I’ve told you __a million times__ not to do that** \\
means “I've told you __too many__ times not to do that.”

**I’m __starving__. I haven’t eaten anything since early morning”** \\
means “I'm __too hungry__. I want something to eat now. I haven't eaten since early morning.”
