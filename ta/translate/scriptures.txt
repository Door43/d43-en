====== Bible Translation Principles ======

===== Culture, Text and Meaning =====

Whenever you translate the scriptures you should be aware of how the culture during the time the text was written affects the meaning of the text. This seven minute video will explain how God spoke to many different cultures, the authors were from diverse cultures, culture and language shaped each portion, and that God wants to communicate a specific meaning in his Word.

===== Word for Word Substitution =====

Literal translations, or word for word substitution, is not the best choice for doing excellent translations because they look only at individual words in the text, result in awkward text, may contain improper grammar, and presents an unclear or wrong meaning in the target text. Watch the video for the [[http://youtu.be/ZUCo2AZlj4A|computer]] or the [[http://youtu.be/_HLy-SkQxzo|portable device]] to learn why word-for-word translations are not the best choice.

===== Form and Meaning =====
The meaning of the text must have a form. The form fits the meaning. This video describes how the form and meaning relates to the message of the source text. Watch the video for the [[http://youtu.be/qLfbc9oXAYw|computer]] or the [[http://youtu.be/ArKusw-bDv0|portable device]].
