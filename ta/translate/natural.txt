To translate the Bible so that it is NATURAL means that: The translation should sound like it was written by a member of the target group—not by a foreigner. \\
In complex sentences identify the words that relate directly to each other in a sentence or clause. When necessary, create shorter sentences for a sense of naturalness and better understanding. In keeping the translation natural understand the way your language works, and test your translation to see if it reads naturally. \\

Identify words that point to one another to form a clause or sentence.  Generally, each verb or action word has words on either side of it that point back to or forward to the action of the verb.  A grouping of words that can stand on its own may be written as an independent clause or a simple sentence. 
 
If necessary, create shorter sentences from these groupings. The Greek language often has long, grammatically complicated sentences. The RSV follows the Greek structure closely and keeps these long sentences in the English translation. When preparing to translate, it is often helpful to rewrite the passage, breaking long sentences up into shorter sentences. This can help you to see the meaning more clearly. In many languages, it is good style to have shorter sentences, or, when sentences are longer, to avoid having complicated sentences. So in re-expressing the meaning in the Target Language, it is sometimes necessary to break up some of the original long sentences into several shorter sentences. This will give readers a better understanding, since many languages are characterized by sentences with only one or two clause groupings.  Shorter sentences can therefore give a sense of naturalness.  Be sure to include clear connection words between clauses and sentences.

Ask yourself the following questions:
  * Have you effectively used your punctuation to help a reader know when to breathe?  
  * What about direct speech?  
  * Are you separating paragraphs?
  * Have you followed the verse numbering of your translation resources?
These points are important in keeping a translation natural.

Use language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language is used in corresponding contexts.
