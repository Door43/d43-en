===== Form and Meaning =====

Two of the major terms used in translating text are "form" and "meaning." These terms are used in special ways in Bible translation. They have the following definitions: 
**Form** - the words, language, grammar, illustrations, idioms, word order, and any other features that are used in the text. 
**Meaning** - the underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader.

Let's consider an example from normal life. Suppose a friend sent you the note below:
"I am having a very difficult week. My mother was sick and I spent all of my money to take her to the doctor and to buy medicine for her. I don't have anything left. My employer will not pay me until next weekend. I don't know how I am going to make it through the week. I don't even have money to buy food." 

==== The Meaning ====
Why do you think the friend sent this note? Just to tell you about his week? Probably not. His true intention was more likely to tell you:  //"I need you to give me money."//\\
That is the "meaning" of the note. However, it would be rude in some cultures to ask for money so directly—even from a friend. Therefore, he adjusted the "form" of the note to fill out the request and help you to understand his need. He wrote in a culturally-acceptable way that presented his need for money but did not obligate you to respond. He explained why he had no money (his sick mother), that his need was only temporary (until he is paid), and that his situation was desperate (no food).
==== The Form ====
In this example, the "form" is the entire text of the note. The "meaning" is "I need you to give me money!" 
We use these terms in a similar way in this course. "Form" will refer to the entire text of the verses that we are translating. "Meaning" will refer to the main idea that the text is trying to communicate.
