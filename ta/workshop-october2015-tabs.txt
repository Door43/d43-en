====== Frequently Used Pages - October ======

We have found that it is very useful to bookmark pages that we use frequently. Bookmarked, or added to favorites, pages allows the Internet user to quickly find frequently used pages.

==== Bookmarked Pages ====

Here is a list of the pages that we will be using a lot during the workshop. You might want to bookmark these:

  * [[:en:bible:notes:dan:home|List of all Daniel chunks]]
  * [[:en:ulb:ep:27-dan.usfm|The entire book of Daniel in the ULB]]
  * [[:en:udb:ep:27-dan.usfm|The entire book of Daniel in the UDB]]

  * [[:en:bible:notes:rev:home|List of all Revelation chunks]]
  * [[:en:ulb:ep:66-rev.usfm|The entire book of Revelation in the ULB]]
  * [[:en:udb:ep:66-rev.usfm|The entire book of Revelation in the UDB]]

  * [[:en:obe:home|Important Terms List]]
  * [[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:quick-reference-notes|Reference Guide for Notes]]
  * [[:en:ta:ta-topics|Translation Academy Topics list]]
  * [[:en:bible:team-info:training:topics:common-words|Common Words]]

Experienced note writers have a list of resources that they find very helpful:

  * [[http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/1.htm|http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/1.htm]] for those that have Greek or Hebrew experience.
  * [[https://lumina.bible.org/bible/Genesis+1|https://lumina.bible.org/bible/Genesis+1]] Lumina - biblical resource
  * [[http://biblehub.com|http://biblehub.com]] to compare multiple translations.
  * [[https://www.biblegateway.com/keyword|https://www.biblegateway.com/keyword]] for looking up specific words. Search the NASB.
  * [[http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary|http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary]]
  * [[http://www.thesaurus.com|http://www.thesaurus.com]] for synonyms
  * [[http://www.learnersdictionary.com|http://www.learnersdictionary.com]] this gives easy definitions for people learning English. This helps word notes in a more understandable way.

==== Organizing the Pages ====

All of us work differently, so that one particular way does not suit us all. Some will use the bookmark bar or a favorites folder or have all the pages set as 'home pages.'

For example, some have found it very useful to have the above pages that we use during the workshop to be ‘saved tabs.’ Here are the links to the how to have saved tabs for 3 browsers:

  * FireFox - [[http://www.ehow.com/how_8262499_set-tabs-pages-firefox.html|http://www.ehow.com/how_8262499_set-tabs-pages-firefox.html]]
  * Chrome - [[http://lifehacker.com/save-sets-of-multiple-tabs-to-launch-later-in-the-bookm-1453967463|http://lifehacker.com/save-sets-of-multiple-tabs-to-launch-later-in-the-bookm-1453967463]]
  * Internet Explorer - [[http://www.7tutorials.com/set-multiple-sites-homepage-internet-explorer-9|http://www.7tutorials.com/set-multiple-sites-homepage-internet-explorer-9]] and [[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/change-home-page#ie=ie-11-win-7|http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/change-home-page#ie=ie-11-win-7]]
