====== Synecdoche ======

Synecdoche is a figure of speech in which 1) the name of a part of something is used to refer to the whole thing, or 2) the name of a whole thing is used to refer to just one part of it.

===== Purposes of Synecdoche =====

1) When something is called by one of its parts, it is not a random part that is chosen. It is usually a part that is significant to what is being said about the thing or it is a part that is very prominent and people are very aware of.

2) When something is called by some bigger thing that it is a part of, it is usually because there is something significant about that bigger thing. But sometimes it is simply a shorthand way of referring to it.

===== Examples from English =====

**Part for Whole** \\
"He bought a new __set of wheels__" means that he bought a new __car__. A set of wheels is a part of a car - a very important part for giving him the freedom to easily go where he wants.

**Whole for Part** \\
__"The ____company__ announced that it was bankrupt" means that __a representative of the company's leadership__ announced that it was bankrupt. A representative is just one of the people in the company.
"__Brazil__ won the World Cup" means that __the team from Brazil__ won the World Cup. "Brazil" is a shorthand way of referring to the team. And saying that "Brazil" won may also hint at the pride that many of the people of that nation would feel about their team winning the World Cup.
===== Examples from the Bible =====

**__My soul__ magnifies the Lord.** Luke 1:46b\\
Mary was was very happy about what the Lord was doing, so she referred to herself by the part of herself that has emotions – her soul.

**for __my eyes__ have seen your salvation,** Luke 2:30\\
When Simeon praised God for letting him see the one God had sent to save people, he referred to himself as his eyes since it it by the eyes that he saw.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Use the word for the item represented by the part or the whole. (__I__  have seen)
  * Use both words. (__With my eyes I__  have seen.)
