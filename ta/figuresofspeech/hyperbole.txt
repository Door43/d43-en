====== Hyperbole [hīˈpərbəlē] ======

A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something. They are not meant to be taken literally (but they are not to be understood as deceitful either).

===== Examples from English =====

**I’ve told you __a million times__ not to do that** \\
means “I've told you __too many__ times not to do that.”

**I’m __starving__. I haven’t eaten anything since early morning”** \\
means “I'm __too hungry__. I want something to eat now. I haven't eaten since early morning.”

**It took __forever__ for him to finish the job** \\
means “It took him __too long__ to finish the job.”
===== Examples from the Bible =====

**When the sun was setting, __all__ those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.** Luke 4:40\\
Luke wrote that "all" brought their sick ones to Jesus. This is a hyperbole. Probably not everyone did this. But many did. The hyperbole helps to show how excited people were that Jesus could heal them.

**When they had brought their boats to land, __they left everything__, and followed him.** Luke 5:11\\
Luke wrote that when Jesus invited some fishermen to follow him, they left everything. We know that they left their fishing business. Saying that they left "everything" may be a case of hyperbole to emphasize that now they were completely committed to following Jesus.

**Then Jesus said to them, “I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or __to kill__?”** Luke 6:9\\
When Jesus asked if it is lawful to kill on the Sabbath, this was hyperbole. He was talking about allowing a person to continue in their suffering by refusing to heal them.

**You will be hated __by all men__ for my name’s sake.** Luke 21:17\\
When Jesus said that "everyone" would hate his followers, he meant that most people would hate his followers. He said “everyone” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.

**If your hand causes you to stumble, __cut it off__. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire,** Mark 9:43a\\
When Jesus said to cut off our hand, he meant that we should do whatever we need to do in order not to sin. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to stop sinning.

**“If anyone comes to me, and doesn’t __hate__ his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.** Luke 14:26\\
When Jesus said "hate", that was hyperbole. He meant that we must not love them more than we love him, that they should not be more important to us than he is, that we must put him first.

**You will be hated __by all men__ for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.** Mark 13:13a\\
Jesus said that “all men” would hate his followers. This was hyperbole. He meant that “most people” would hate his followers. He said “all men” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.

**For from you has sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also __in every place__ your faith toward God has gone forth; so that we need not to say anything.** 1 Thes 1:8 When Paul wrote "in every place," he meant that people in “many far away places” were talking about them. Paul probably used this hyperbole to show how happy he was that the Thessalonians’ faith in God was so great that many people had heard about it.
===== Translation Tips =====

  * Keep the hyperbole if it would not misunderstood or thought to be a lie.
  * Express the meaning without the hyperbole. For example "All the people" could be translated as "large crowds of people"
  * If you decide to express the meaning without the hyperbole, be sure that it truly is hyperbole. God does miraculous things. Don't assume that just because something seems to be impossible, it could not have happened.
