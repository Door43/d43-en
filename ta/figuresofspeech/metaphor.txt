====== Metaphor ======

A metaphor is a figure of speech that creates a 'word picture' by relating one thing (the topic of the metaphor) to an unrelated object. Metaphors imply (or state directly) that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. (See [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|Simile]].)

The characteristics that the two objects have in common are their "points of similarity." In metaphors, the point(s) of similarity and even the topic are often implicit (not directly stated).

Understanding the Greek root of the word metaphor may help clarify what a metaphor is: the original word means carry across or transfer. A metaphor transfers an image from one familiar object to another object that is less easily understood. (For example, "Life is a journey," helps convey a concept about life that an author desires to emphasize.)

===== Purposes of Metaphor =====

  * One purpose of metaphor is to teach about something that is unknown by indicating that it is similar to something that is already known.
  * Another purpose of metaphor is to emphasize that something has a particular trait or to indicate that it has that particular trait in an extreme way.
  * Another purpose of metaphor is to lead people to react emotionally to one thing as they would to another.

===== Examples from English =====

**He was a walking __dictionary__.**  \\ Because he knows the meanings of so many words, he is compared to a dictionary. Dictionaries contain the meanings of many words.

**His __temper flared__  when she insulted him.**  \\ His temper, or anger, is compared to a fire that suddenly bursts into flame.

**Her __heart broke__  when her baby died.**  \\ Her heart, or emotions, is compared to a physical thing that can break.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Jesus said to them. “I am the __bread of life__. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty."**  John 6:35 \\ Jesus compared himself to bread, a food that people ate all the time then. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.

**… __the rising sun will__  come from heaven to help us, __to shine__  on those who sit in __darkness__  and the __shadow of death__.**  Luke 1:78b-79a \\ This verse has several related metaphors. The Savior is compared to the rising sun, teaching spiritual truth is compared to the sun shining, lacking spiritual truth is compared to sitting in darkness, and the fear of death is compared to a shadow. This means that just as the rising sun shines on those who have been living in darkness, the Savior will come and bring spiritual truth to those who lack spiritual truth and are afraid of death.

**… who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Therefore produce __fruits__  worthy of repentance. "Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees. __Every tree__, therefore, __that does not produce good fruit__  is __cut down__, and thrown into the fire.”**  Luke 3:7b, 8a, 9 \\ There are two metaphors shown above. People's behavior is compared to fruit on a tree. Good behavior is like good fruit and bad behavior is like bad fruit. In the second metaphor God's judgeent is compared to someone cutting down a tree. Just as a farmer cuts down a tree that does not bear good fruit, God judges and punishes people who do not repent from their bad behavior and turn to good behavior.

**Don't quench the Spirit.**  1 Thessalonians 5:19 \\ In this metaphor, Paul compares God's Spirit, or the urging of God's Spirit, to a fire. And he compares refusing to obey the Spirit's urging to putting out a fire. Refusing to obey the Spirit's urging keeps him from working in our lives, just as throwing water on a fire extinguishes it and stops it from burning. Notice that in this metaphor, the images of fire and water are not stated explicitly. Rather it is the verb "quench" that lead us to think of fire and water.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * If the image in the original is unknown to your people, use one from your own culture. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. We don't want to have comparisons to things that had not been invented when the books of the Bible were first written.
  * Or if the image in the original is unknown to your people, simply state the point of similarity without using an image.
  * If it would be unclear to your readers how the topic is like the image, you can state the point of similarity explicitly. However, do not do this if it was not clear to the original audience.
  * If the topic is not stated clearly in the original and it would be unclear to your readers what the topic is, state the topic explicitly. However, do not do this if the topic was not clear to the original audience. For example, in Matthew 16:6, Jesus told his disciples "Beware of the __yeast__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees." His disciples thought he was talking about bread, but Jesus was warning them about the __teaching__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That was the topic.
  * Change the metaphor to a simile by adding "like" or "as".
