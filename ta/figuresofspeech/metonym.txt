====== Metonym [ˈmetəˌnim] ======

===== This is the same information as on the Metonymy page. Should there be two separate pages? =====

Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A metonym is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.

===== Purposes of Metonymy =====

Metonymy can be used:

  * as an shorter way of referring to something
  * to make an abstract idea more memorable by referring to it with the name of a concrete object associated with it.
  * to keep certain people from knowing what is being referred to

===== English Examples =====

**“__The pot__  is boiling”** \\ means “__The water in the pot__  is boiling.”

**“__The pen__  is mightier than __the sword__“** \\ means “Writing one's ideas and reasons is more effective than fighting.”

**“Could you give me __a hand__  with this work?”** \\ means “Could you __help__  me with this work?”

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**The Lord God will give him __the throne__  of his father, David.**  Luke 1:32 \\ A throne represents the authority of a king. Throne is a metonym for “kingly authority,” “kingship” or, “reign”. This means that God would make him become the king that was to follow King David.

**and he will reign over __the house of Jacob__  forever.**  Luke 1:33a \\ The word “house” is often used in the Bible as a metonym for “household”, the people living in the house. This, too, can be a metonym for descendants. So “the house of Jacob” in this verse refers to “Jacob's descendants”.

**who warned you to flee from __the wrath__  to come?**  Luke 3:7b \\ The word “wrath” or “anger” is a metonym for “punishment.” God was extremely angry with the people, and as a result, he would punish them.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * If a metonym is used in poetry or a sermon or some other kind of formal speech, and if the readers would be able to recognize what it refers to, use the metonym.
  * If the metonym is simply an idiom, or if it would be unclear to the readers, use the name of the thing the metonym refers to. (See [[https://door43.org/en/ta/figuresofspeech/idiom|Idiom </font> ]])
