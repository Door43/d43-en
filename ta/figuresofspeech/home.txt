**Allegory**

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:apostrophe|Apostrophe]]**- In apostrophe, a speaker turns his attention from the people he is speaking to and makes an exclamation to someone who is not there with them.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:doublet|Doublet]]**- A doublet states the same thought in two ways. In the Bible, doublets are often used in poetry, prophecy, and sermons

**Epithet**

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:euphemism|Euphemism]]**- A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing. It's purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it.

**Exclamations**

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:hendiadys|Hendiadys]]**- In hendiadys a single idea is expressed with two words connected with “and,” when one word could be used to modify the other.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:hyperbole|Hyperbole]]**- A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:idiom|Idiom]]**- An idiom is a group of words that has a meaning that is different from what one would understand from the meanings of the individual words.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:irony|Irony]]**- In irony, a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:litotes|Litotes]]**- Litotes is an emphatic statement made by saying that the opposite idea is not true.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]]**- A metaphor is a figure of speech in which words for one thing or action are applied to something else in order to imply that there is something that the two things have in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy|Metonymy]]**- Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A metonym is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:personification|Personification]]**- Personification is a kind of simile or metaphor, in which an idea or something that is not alive is referred to as if it were a person and could do the things people do or have the attributes people have.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]]**- A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. Often it indicates the speaker’s attitude toward the topic or the listener. Often it is used for rebuking or scolding, but some languages have other purposes as well.

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|Simile]]**- In a simile something is compared to something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they have in common. The fact that there is a comparison is stated clearly with ‘like’ or ‘as’. The thing that is being talked about is the “topic.” The thing it is compared to is the “image.” The trait that they have in common is the “point of similarity.”

**[[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:synecdoche|Synecdoche]]**- Synecdoche is a figure of speech in which 1) the name of a part of something is used to refer to the whole thing, or 2) the name of a whole thing is used to refer to just one part of it.
