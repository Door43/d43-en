===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * When a doublet is used in poetry, a sermon, or prophecy, either keep the doublet, or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in poetry, sermons, and prophecies.
  * When the doublet is used in a story (a narrative text), either keep the doublet or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in narrative.
