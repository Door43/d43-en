====== Apostrophe [əˈpästrəfē] ======


In apostrophe, a speaker turns his attention from the people he is speaking to and makes an exclamation to someone who is not there with them. He could even speak to an imaginary person or a thing or idea that is treated as if it were a person (See [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:personificationversion2|Personification]].)


(To clarify, this is a literary device, not a punctuation mark.)

===== Purposes for Apostrophe =====


Apostrophe can be used to show a person's feelings toward a particular non-living thing or to a person who is not present. In the Bible it is often used in prophecy as prophets addressed nations who were not expected to read the book at that time.


Apostrophes help writers convey abstract concepts such as death (or community responsibility) with emotion that can touch a reader.

===== Examples from English =====


**__O my dear baby,__ why did you have to get sick and leave us?** 


**__Silly dog,__ what are you barking for now?** 


**__O pesky computer__, why will you not let me correct this sentence?**

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**__Jerusalem, Jerusalem,__ that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her!...** Luke 13:34a (WEB)\\ 
Jesus made this exclamation to the people of Jerusalem as if they were there listening to him. But he was outside the city, and the people of the city were not there listening to him. And some of what he said was addressed to people who had lived long ago and were no longer alive. In this way he expressed his sadness deep sadness about the people of Jerusalem.

**__Death__, where is your sting? __Hades__, where is your victory?** 1 Cor 15:55 (WEB)\\ 
Paul was speaking to death as if it were a person and taunting it because it will not have any power to harm people.

**Woe to you, __O Moab__! the people of Chemosh is undone; for your sons are taken away captive, and your daughters into captivity.** Jeremiah 48:46 \\ 
In Jeremiah 48, God was telling the people of Israel what he would do to one of their enemies, the nation of Moab. Then God spoke to the people of Moab as if they were there and listening to him.

**Sing, __you heavens__, for Yahweh has done it; shout, __you lower parts of the earth__; break forth into singing, __you mountains__, __O forest__, and __every tree in it__: for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.** Isaiah 44:23 \\ 
In Isaiah 44, Isaiah wrote what the Lord was saying to his people. Then Isaiah stopped telling about what the Lord was saying and he told the heavens and earth, mountains and forest, to praise God. It highlights how great God is that even the inanimate parts of creation should praise him.


===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * You may put the name of the one being spoken to first, to show that the speaker has drawn his attention away from his primary audience to another audience.
  * Some languages have a marker that shows that someone is being spoken to. For example, English speakers used to use "O" before saying the name of the one they were talking to as in "O Moab" and "O forest."
