===== Using Door43 Session =====

Actions to Know

  * **Right click on a link **  to open a new window or new tab - almost all of the links in Door43 will close the window you are in when opening the new window. Sometimes you may want to open another window so that 2, or more, are open at the same time.
  * **Duplicating the tab **- this is another way to have 2 Internet browser windows open at the same time.
  * **Arrange 2 Internet browser windows next to each other**
  * **Bookmarking or Adding to Favorites **- you may find it convenient to keep a few Door43 pages as bookmarks.
==== Am I Logged In? ====

  * Look at the area on the right above the double lines above.
  * Is the word //Login //  at the top right of the window? You are not logged in.
  * Is the word //Logout//  at the top right of the window? You are logged in and should see the pencil icon on the right side of the window.
